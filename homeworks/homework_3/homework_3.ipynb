      "Turkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by MPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%. The move, which was justified on national security grounds, follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves a veto over foreign investments. Turkcell said the decision \"increases the risks\" attached to the project. Although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal. \"The possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero,\" said Atinc Ozkan, analyst at Finans Investment in Istanbul. If Turkcell does back out, MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turkcell's mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran to run into trouble. Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran's new Imam Khomeini International Airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004. In both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the Turkish firms are too close to Israel. The hardline posture taken by parliament, which is dominated by religious conservatives, could yet impact other inward investments.\n",

In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Parmalat Finanziaria detailed administrators' latest plans for re-listing the shares of the group.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the re-listing on the Italian stock exchange, creditors' debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros. The company's creditors will be asked to vote on the plan later this year. The plan is likely to give creditors of Parmalat Finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed. This is lower than the 11.3% creditors previously hoped to receive. Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.\n",

      "Edinburgh City Council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital. But Green MSP Mark Ballard fears people not on the council's edited electoral register may miss out. Local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters, such as the transport referendum. Therefore, residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of February's voting deadline. Mr Ballard said: \"This vote will set the future of transport in Edinburgh for decades to come. \"It is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in Edinburgh City and the surrounding areas, are registered to vote in the ballot. \"Many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say. \"Everyone involved in this debate - both for and against - wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible, and that means encouraging people to take part.\" The ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council's proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. The outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council. Towards the end of February, the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to Scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.\n",

      "A British terror suspect held in Guantanamo Bay for 33 months plans to sue the government, it is reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin Mubanga claimed in the Observer that an MI6 officer played a key role in consigning him to the US camp in Cuba, following his arrest in Zambia. Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. The home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not \"well informed\". Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002. Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam. But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead. Mr Mubanga said the \"MI6 agent\" told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission. Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "His lawyer Louise Christian said: \"'We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo.\" And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga's transfer to Guantanamo. But a Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of British intelligence or security agencies. And Home Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost: \"I'm not organising a specific investigation into it.\" Mr Mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. He told the Observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last March, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.\n",
      "\n",
      "He claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts. And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: \"I've lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim. He added: \"The authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. They've made me what I am - even if I'm not quite sure yet who that person is.\" The US government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture. In a statement, it said: \"The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. \"He was detained to prevent him from fighting against the US and our allies in the war on terror.\" But Fair Trials Abroad director Stephen Jakobi said there were similarities between Mr Mubanga's account and those of other Guantanamo detainees. He said: \"The pattern is the same. The real problem is the concentration camp conditions in Guantanamo. \"Is [Charles Clarke] really pretending this is all made up?\" Mr Mubanga and the three other freed British detainees were released without charge by UK police on their return from Cuba.\n",

      "Brown shrugs off economy fears\n",
      "\n",
      "Gordon Brown is to freeze petrol duty increases, fund a £1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an upbeat pre-Budget report, he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. The chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in UK \"industrial history\" but denied he was \"gloating\". But Oliver Letwin, for the Tories, attacked government red tape and debt, dubbing Mr Brown \"Sir Wastealot\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The shadow chancellor said Mr Brown's \"golden rule\" had \"turned to dross in his hands\" and said he was borrowing to spend, not invest, with predicted debt over the coming years totalling £170bn. Mr Letwin told MPs: \"The tide is going out on the chancellor's credibility. He is spending, borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer's money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Brown of ducking tough choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said: \"Last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency. \"There are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the UK housing market and rising personal debt. But they have not been confronted.\" Mr Brown rejected the Lib Dem's call to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. BBC economic editor Evan Davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Brown's insistence he was not \"gloating\" was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new European Commissioner Peter Mandelson. In his speech, he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if Labour wins the next election.\n",
      "\n",
      "It includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine, with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. He also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from April 2007. And funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while their parents were at work. Taken together, the measures would create a \"welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history\", said Mr Brown. He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year, the chancellor said he was providing an extra £1bn for local councils. The money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt \"low and sustainable\" - both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in March's budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget. Inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow, Mr Brown forecast. He also pledged an extra £105m for security and counter-terrorism. Business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. But there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working. Simon Sweetman, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.\"\n",

Trouble flared after nine French peacekeepers were killed and President Jacques Chirac ordered the destruction of the Ivory Coast's air force. A company of 100-120 UK troops is understood to have been put on standby. They are ready to fly out and secure the route from the embassy to the airport if called upon. Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said: \"There are British nationals in Ivory Coast and as you can imagine we are making the usual contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates further, but that's all I can say at this stage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He added the situation would be monitored carefully in case evacuation became necessary. France has played a lead role in international peacekeeping in Ivory Coast - a former colony - after President Laurent Gbagbo broke an 18-month ceasefire with rebels bombing their positions and killing the nine French soldiers. The decision to destroy the African nation's small air force prompted riots against French and other foreign nationals. The Spanish have already put their forces on standby to evacuate their nationals if necessary.\n",

      "Council tax rise 'reasonable'\n",
      "\n",
      "Welsh councils should set their taxes at \"reasonable levels\" after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finance Minister Sue Essex said it was a \"good deal\" for local government. The £3.2bn settlement includes the \"full\" £7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition, £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was \"confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.\" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that \"significant\" cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed. \"A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems,\" said Mr Wellington. \"It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.\" On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds. Ms Essex said: \"I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. \"I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.\" She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, \"even for those people who have moved up a band\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said: \"This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.\" Plaid Cymru's local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement \"hugely disappointing\". He said: \"Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger.\" \"This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both.\" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said: \"I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.\" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change \"is taking spin to the very verge of deception\". He added: \"Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.\"\n",

      "New drink limit 'would cut toll'\n",
      "\n",
      "More lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says.\n",
      "\n",
      "University College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the government's Road Safety Bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport Document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year. The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. Professor Allsop said: \"Reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver's BAC [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit. \"Only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ministers do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. They believe educating drivers is more important. The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers' attitudes to drink-driving. Road safety head Andrew Howard said: \"It remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. Britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone.\" Liberal Democrat transport spokesman John Thurso said drink-driving remained a \"major killer\", with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. He said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997, which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. The Road Safety Bill, which gets its second reading on Tuesday, would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed. It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system, penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties. In an article for the Times newspaper, Ms Dunwoody, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, says: \"Slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists. \"It is quite simple: if you hit someone at 30mph, they have a 50 per cent chance of survival. If you are going at 40mph, nine times out of ten they will die.\"\n",

      "BMW cash to fuel Mini production\n",
      "\n",
      "Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced £100m of new investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,\" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"The risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,\" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from £12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker's. The consumers' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.\n",

      "\n",
      "European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "A levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world's poorest nations. Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure. The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines. It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the \"competitiveness of the airlines\". Ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing European public spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the G7 Group and World Economic Forum. The world's richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting. At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states.\n",

      "Further rise in UK jobless total\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK's jobless total rose for the second month in a row in December, official figures show.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of people out of work rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004, even as 90,000 more people were in employment. Average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to December up from November's 4.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) added. Meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. While the UK's jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in Germany, 10.4% in Spain and 9.7% in France. But, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. The figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the Bank of England will almost certainly raise rates this year. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities told Reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, \"it is enough to underline that they (the BoE) will be more hawkish on rates\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Labour and the Conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing \"cold calls\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. The information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but there is a \"grey\" area if personal data is kept. Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. But that did not happen for \"voter identification\" calls. \"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,\" he said. \"So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers. She said: \"We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do things that are not allowed in the law.\" A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person. \"If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. The spokesman said there was \"no yes or no\" answer and the area was \"pretty grey\". He added: \"If someone complained, then we would investigate that. Political parties are aware of the regulations. At the last by-elections, we reminded them.\" Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: \"The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal.\" He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are \"significant\" numbers of such calls. \"I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,\" he tells the commissioner. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.\n",

      "Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time. The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. It is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election, widely expected on 5 May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next month's Budget will be Mr Brown's eighth since Labour came to power in 1997. If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election. A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue. The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office. As Mr Brown announced the Budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm Ernst & Young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. \"In the Budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,\" said Aidan O'Carroll, E&Y's UK head of tax.\n",

      "US retail sales fell 0.3% in January, the biggest monthly decline since last August, driven down by a heavy fall in car sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected, coming after December's 4% rise in car sales, fuelled by generous pre-Christmas special offers. Excluding the car sector, US retail sales were up 0.6% in January, twice what some analysts had been expecting. US retail spending is expected to rise in 2005, but not as quickly as in 2004.\n",

Sales at appliance and electronic stores were down 0.6% in January, while sales at hardware stores dropped by 0.3% and furniture store sales dipped 0.1%. Sales at clothing and clothing accessory stores jumped 1.8%, while sales at general merchandise stores, a category that includes department stores, rose by 0.9%. These strong gains were in part put down to consumers spending gift vouchers they had been given for Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sales at restaurants, bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%, while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. In December, overall retail sales rose by 1.1%. Excluding the car sector, sales rose by just 0.3%. Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004. \"Consumers continue to retain their strength in the first quarter,\" he said. Van Rourke, a bond strategist at Popular Securities, agreed that the latest retail sales figures were \"slightly stronger than expected\".\n",

      "Minimum rate for foster parents\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs, the government has announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Payment levels vary from area to area, with some carers getting just £50 a week for clothes, food and other costs. Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible. However local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found. About 50,000 children live with foster families in the UK and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Hodge said: \"Foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. \"We need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. \"Our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity.\" The government is seeking to amend the Children Bill, which passes through the Commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fostering Network executive director Robert Tapsfield criticised the existing system. \"There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. \"And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets.\" The charity recommends a weekly payment of £108.49 for looking after a baby. In a survey, it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as £100 per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) said it agreed in principle with the government's plans. Tony Hunter, the organisation's president, said: \"There are many devils and lots of details hidden within the Government's proposals. \"But ADSS fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "But he said replacing the controversial CSA would be \"the nuclear option\". A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks. Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: \"If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed. It warned that it could be five years before the CSA was \"fit for purpose\", describing it as \"a failing organisation\" and \"in crisis\" with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations. The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the \"abandonment option\", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "And responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I certainly wouldn't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. \"But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn't going to work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The MPs launched their inquiry into the CSA's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up. The MPs found the £456m system from American IT giant EDS was \"nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate\". Faced with the committee's criticism, the government has suspended its plan to cut the agency's staff by 25%. The CSA has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.\n",

Theresa May, Tory shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \"We have got to find a way that's going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them.\" The agency's former chief executive Doug Smith quit last autumn claiming he was \"seriously disappointed\" with its performance. The committee said the National Audit Office should investigate why the EDS system had gone so badly wrong.

      "Blunkett row should end - Blair\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny. Sir Alan Budd found a \"chain of events\" linked Mr Blunkett to Leoncia Casalme's indefinite leave to remain application. At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday Sir Alan said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by Kimberly Quinn's nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average. But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. In his first comments since Sir Alan's announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail. But told BBC News: \"As far as I'm concerned, we have drawn a line under that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked if Mr Blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point, he replied: \"I have made my admiration for David very clear and it remains. \"He's been a tremendous colleague, he's done a great job for us, first as home secretary then as education secretary. The future is something we will have to approach in the future.\" The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader Michael Howard that he led a \"grubby government\". He said Mr Blunkett's integrity remained intact: \"He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. He accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened, he said. \"But I think Sir Alan Budd also accepted there wasn't some conspiracy or cover-up and I just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, Mr Howard said: \"There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry. There were so many questions that weren't answered.\" There was \"deceit at the heart of government\" which was not limited to the visa affair, he argued. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was \"a strong case for a judge-led judicial review\".\n",
      "\n",

It may be about something even more important than that.\" Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan's findings.

      "\n",
      "Shares in Multiplex Group, which is building the new Wembley stadium, fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Australian firm said it would only break even on the 1.2bn Australian dollars (£458m; $874m) rebuild, after a rise in costs on the work. Any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added. It cut A$68m from profit targets for Wembley and another UK project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors were shaken by the news and the firm's shares fell to a four month low of A$4.50, before recovering to close 16% down at A$4.67. The decline came despite Multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to A$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. Increased costs at Wembley and a separate development in London's Docklands saw Multiplex's construction division report profits of A$35.1m.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its UK projects - which also include the White City redevelopment scheme in west London - were performing strongly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To recoup any profit from Wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, Multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. These claims could take up to two years to resolve. \"Multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position,\" it said. \"It is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised.\" Wembley Stadium is to due to be completed in January and will officially open for the 2006 FA Cup Final. Analysts expressed concern at the unexpected paring back in profit. \"Such a big writeback on the Wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility,\" Simon Wheatley, from Goldman Sachs, told Reuters.\n",

      "Report attacks defence spending\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "A National Audit Office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by £1.7bn in the past year. It says there is \"little evidence\" the MoD's performance had improved, despite the introduction of a \"smart acquisition\" policy six years ago. A senior defence official told the BBC lessons were being learned. The NAO's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach £50bn - 14% higher than originally planned. The total delays amounted to 62 months, with average individual delays rising by three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. \"Many problems can be traced to the fact that the MoD has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,\" the report says. The NAO found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older \"legacy projects\", such as the Eurofighter. A senior defence official, speaking to the BBC's defence correspondent Paul Adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. This year's overspend was significantly less than last year's £3.1bn total, and the Defence Procurement Agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Bach, Minister for Defence Procurement, said he was \"obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown\", but insisted that the Defence Procurement Agency had \"undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects\". The latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months, and, according to our correspondent, contain few new surprises. Turning around the Defence Procurement Agency \"was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed\", he said. Our correspondent said it was the same projects, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the Nimrod and A400M aircraft and the Type 45 Destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay. But he added some projects, such as the C-17 heavy lift aircraft and Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF), were showing good performances.\n",

      "David McLetchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Scottish Conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with Tods Murray did not influence the causes he supports. But on Friday he said: \"I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect.\" Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. Labour said he had \"cleverly\" not asked about paid advocacy. A Tory spokesman \"totally refuted\" any wrongdoing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport. The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development. Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: \"I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. \"However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. \"To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. \"I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was \"very clever\" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. \"He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,\" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings \"where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner\". However, MSPs' Code of Conduct \"recognises a wider definition\" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a letter from Holyrood's Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie's decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: \"This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future. \"However it doesn't change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. Ms Sturgeon said: \"I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and I'm sure he will be reflecting on it.\" She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not \"lose any sleep over it\". Peter Misselbrook, executive partner of Tods Murray said Mr McLetchie had been considering retirement later in the year. He added: \"David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The prime minister is trying to draw a line under speculation over the state of his relationship with Gordon Brown with the speech in Chatham, Kent. He is saying that prosperity means both individual wealth and ensuring \"radically improved\" public services. He is also claiming Labour is more ideologically united than ever. Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity. Now Mr Blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of Labour's platform for a third term in government. Labour made low inflation, unemployment and mortgage rates the centrepiece of a new poster campaign this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on Thursday Mr Blair is saying: \"I want to talk about the central purpose ofNew Labour - which is to increase personal prosperity and well-being, not justfor a few but for all. \"By prosperity I mean both the income and wealth of individuals and theirfamilies, and the opportunity and security available to them through radicallyimproved public services and a reformed welfare state.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tories are trying to capitalise on the apparent feud at the top of government. On Wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and Mr Brown under the words \"How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?\" Michael Howard and frontbencher John Redwood on Thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos. They say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make Britain more competitive.\n",

      "The Liberal Democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. The latest speculation about relations between New Labour's two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book, Brown's Britain by Robert Preston. In it he alleges that Mr Blair told Mr Brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. The book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him. Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\" On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\"\n",

      "South Korea looks set to sustain its revival thanks to renewed private consumption, its central bank says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country's economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers' credit card spending spree. Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year. \"The economy is now heading upward rather than downward,\" said central bank governor Park Seung. \"The worst seems to have passed.\" Mr Park's statement came as the bank decided to keep interest rates at an all-time low of 3.25%. It had cut rates in November to help revive the economy, but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in January - has stopped it from cutting further. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. Other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health. Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December. Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers' bad debts. The government last year tightened the rules for card lending to keep the card glut under control.\n",

      "German business confidence slides\n",
      "\n",
      "German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Munich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months. The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.\n",

      "Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's \"chaotic\" asylum system under Tony Blair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997. Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. Other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked Tory plans for annual limits on numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world's \"genuine refugees\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution,\" he was due to say. \"But if we are to fulfil responsibility, we have to get a grip of the system. \"Fair play matters. People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused,\" he said. \"And let's be clear. Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity.\" Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.\n",
      "\n",
      "That prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. \"If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven,\" said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council. \"If people turn up in the UK asking for help they will be turned away. Michael Howard's policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the UK. \"When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. So many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned, rising to half for some nationalities. \"We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. On Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\"\n",

YouGov polled a weighted sample of 1,981 voters online on 16-18 December. Mr Blunkett resigned as Home Secretary on Wednesday after an inquiry uncovered an e-mail showing a visa application by Mrs Quinn's former nanny had been speeded up. Sir Alan Budd's inquiry also found Mr Blunkett's account of events had been wrong. Almost a quarter (21%) of those polled for the Sunday Times said he should return to the Cabinet straight after the election. One in four said he should be back in the Government's top ranks within a year or two while 39% opposed a comeback.\n",

      "Lucy, 36, tracked down Mr Pound after her birth mother told her he was known as \"Precious\" at school. Despite being told he was a \"nutter who died at sea\" she found a reference to Mr Pound on Friends Reunited. Lucy's mother kept her pregnancy secret and had her adopted at four weeks. Mr Pound found out about it last year. That happened when Lucy wrote to his Parliamentary office saying she believed he was her father.\n",

I felt guilt in the marrow of my bones,\" said the Ealing North MP. \"I don't blame Lucy's mother. I was pretty much out of control. I was 18 when she was conceived. It was a different time - it was pretty wild.\"\n",

The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking. \"As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities.\" BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown's article was \"a warning shot\" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. \"It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,\" was Mr Marr's assessment. The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be \"central\". Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was \"in part\" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy. And he pledged childcare would be a \"centrepiece\" of Labour's manifesto. He also predicted the next general election will be a \"tough, tough fight\" for New Labour. But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May. Mr Blair said he was taking \"nothing for granted\" ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.\n",

      "Billions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism, the UN's Food & Agriculture Organisation has warned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade barriers and subsidies \"severely\" distort the market, the FAO report on the \"State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004\" said. As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. These countries are mainly situated in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n",

      "Germany's economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004, upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in Europe's biggest economy. The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%, after a year of contraction in 2003, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward. Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. According to the statistics office, Destatis, rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the relentless rise in the value of the euro last year has also hit the competitiveness of German products overseas. The effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole, as well as Germany. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but senior officials at the rate-setting European Central Bank are beginning to talk about the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise. The ECB's mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten Germany's hopes of recovery.\n",

Deputy Health Minister Rhona Brankin has pledged to study the research. SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.\n",

      "The rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the \"care development group\" of Scottish Executive experts who prepared the original costings, according to findings published in the Quarterly Economic Commentary of Strathclyde University's Fraser of Allander Institute. \"Dubious\" assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022, the report warned.\n",

The prosecution's star witness, former WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan, has said that Mr Ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to \"hit our books\". However, Ms Cooper said Mr Sullivan had not mentioned \"anything uncomfortable\" about WorldCom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. Mr Ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI. Last week, MCI agreed to a buyout by Verizon Communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.\n",

      "EU aiming to fuel development aid\n",
      "\n",
      "European Union finance ministers meet on Thursday to discuss proposals, including a tax on jet fuel, to boost development aid for poorer nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The policy makers are to ask for a report into how more development money can be raised, the EU said. The world's richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. Airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Profits have been under pressure in the airline industry, with low-cost firms driving down prices and demand dipping after the 11 September terrorist attacks and the outbreak of the killer SARS virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things have picked up, but some European and US companies are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states. \"Of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives, but why target the airlines?\" said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary general of the Association of European Airlines. \"Our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs,\" he continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU sought to allay the airlines' fears, stressing that Thursday's meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration. It added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel \"should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development\". Any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines, the EU said. There is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting of the world's richest nations - from EU ministers. The issue of poverty in Africa and South Asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda, with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done. At their meeting in London, G7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries.\n",

      "Japan turns to beer alternatives\n",
      "\n",
      "Japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itself\n",
      "\n",
      "Beer and spirits are heavily taxed in Japan, driving breweries to search for alternatives. Japan's long economic downturn helped drive the trend, as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows. Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called \"beer-like\" drinks is set to grow 84% this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt. The chosen name, \"Shinnama\" or \"new draft\", disguises its non-beer nature. But despite a record profit in 2004 of 30.6bn yen ($291m; £154m), up 31.8% on the previous year, Asahi is coming late to the market. Key rival Sapporo is already well-established with the beer-flavoured \"Draft One\". Suntory, meanwhile, is doing well with \"Super Blue\", which combines happoshu - an existing low-cost beer alternative made with malt and seawater - and shochu, a distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley. Happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost. Kirin, the fourth big name, is launching its own \"third-type\" drink in April.\n",

      "Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, touring South East Asian countries, praised the \"spirit of cooperation\" in achieving the breakthrough. Media reports in both countries describe the deal as a major step in the ongoing peace process. Mr Straw said he hoped the agreement would make a difference to Kashmiris. The bus service was one of several announcements made after a meeting of foreign ministers of both countries in Islamabad on Wednesday. Kashmiri politicians on both sides of the Line of Control which divides the region welcomed the move.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, Mr Straw said the bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad \"will be able to reunite families that have been divided for decades\". \"This will make a real difference to the lives of Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control,\" he said. \"I warmly applaud the efforts of both India and Pakistan to make this happen. \"This spirit of cooperation will, I hope, lead to many more measures that will benefit all in the region.\"\n",

      "On Thursday Mr Straw was in India visiting Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar where he tried his hand at making Indian bread or roti. He is due to take part in talks with the Indian government on Friday. A second bus service linking the Pakistani city of Lahore with Amritsar in India was also announced as well as a rail link between Rajasthan state and Pakistan's Sindh province. Both sides agreed to begin talks on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents and also said they planned to reopen their respective consulates in Karachi and Mumbai (Bombay).

      "Kilroy launches 'Veritas' party\n",
      "\n",
      "Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk has said he wants to \"change the face of British politics\" as he launched his new party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party,said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration. He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for \"truth\" - would avoid the old parties' \"lies and spin\". UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he was glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. And he announced the party would be holding a leadership election. On Thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader. UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his decision to quit UKIP at a public meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire last week. It came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections. \"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said. \"I will be standing at the next general election. I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. \"And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would \"deliver better\" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk. It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!\n",
      "\n",
      "Every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It's all flash and no real policy here\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Veritas? The name will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?\n",

      "Muslim police stops 'more likely'\n",
      "\n",
      "UK Muslims should accept that people of Islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a Home Office minister has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hazel Blears said innocent Muslims would be targeted because of the search for Islamic extremists. Qualifications for religious leaders to enter the UK could also be made tougher, she told a Commons inquiry. Her comments have been described as \"irresponsible\" and \"outrageous\" by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC).\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of Islam, or who are falsely hiding behind Islam,\" the Salford MP told the Commons home affairs committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community.\" It was a reality that should be recognised, she said. \"If a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area,\" she added. On ministers of religions, such as imams, she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills, such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community, should be demanded. Last year, ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak English to a certain level.\n",
      "\n",
      "IHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of \"playing an Islamophobia card\" in the run-up to a general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is demonising and alienating our community,\" he said. \"It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. \"This sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists.\" Later, the prime minister's official spokesman urged people to put Ms Blears' comments into context. The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. \"It is not aimed at a particular community, it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community,\" he added. Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figures showed that, for 2003/2004, Asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year. Separate figures on police searches in England and Wales carried out under the Terrorism Act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted. Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. In 2003/2004, 12.5% searches under the laws were on Asian people, even though they make up 4.7% of the population. Last July, the police were accused of Islamophobia by Muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of Asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti-terror laws.\n",

      "\n",
      "Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation's reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple's decision to marry. But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: \"I'm just coming down to earth.\" She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters. Charles said he and his wife-to-be were \"absolutely delighted\". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them \"very happy\". Princes William and Harry said they are \"very happy\" and wish the couple \"all the luck in the future\". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George's Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. \"His divorce from Diana and the disappointment the country felt over how Diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince Charles],\" said Ros Coward, who wrote the authorised biography of Diana, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: \"I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step.\" Tony Blair said he was \"delighted\" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. Australia's Prime Minister John Howard also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a \"sensible and a good thing\". Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince's Trust. Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.\n",

      "\"Britain is heading in the wrong direction\", the Conservative leader said in his New Year message. Mr Blair's government was a \"bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals,\" he added. But Labour's campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: \"Britain is working, don't let the Tories wreck it again\". Mr Howard also paid tribute to the nation's character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster. The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. \"Yet Britain's response has shone a light on our nation's character. The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever.\" He went on to reflect on the values that \"most Britons hold dear\". Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to \"turn these beliefs into reality\" and set out the choices he says are facing Britain. \"How much tax do people want to pay? Who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want? \"Who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the \"wrong solution\" to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice. \"Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.\" The Tories, he said, can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. \"We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. \"We simply need to change direction. The election will give Britain the chance to change.\" This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Labour spokesman Mr Kemp said: \"It would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 April, not 1 January.\" \"Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. \"With Labour Britain is working.

      "\n",
      "The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud. It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts. The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. It said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. The report said: \"Member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the European Anti-Fraud Office on a consistent basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As the court has now qualified its opinion on the Community accounts for a decade, it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of EU revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of EU resources.\" It said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth £38.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002. At the same time, reported fraud throughout the EU dropped from 10,276 cases worth £808m to 8,177 cases worth £644m. Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community,\" he said. \"Departments responsible for administering EU funds need to make sure that they're doing everything possible to weed out improper spending. \"The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management.\" A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting. \"The quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state, and there is room for improvement,\" spokesman Jorg Wojahn said. He added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by NAO providing a \"good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud\".\n",

Bill Armstrong, a retail analyst at CL King & Associates, said he expected to see other private investment firms come forward for Circuit City.

      "Lufthansa said that it may lose millions of euros as a result of Air Force One landing at Frankfurt airport. Flights were affected for an hour on Wednesday morning, double the time that had been expected, leading to cancellations and delays. Lufthansa accounts for six out of every 10 planes using Frankfurt's airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are doing research into the possibilities we have,\" Michael Lamberty, a Lufthansa spokesman told the BBC. \"We are checking if there is action to be taken and in which courts it could be taken.\" Mr Lamberty explained that the company did not plan to pursue Germany's air traffic controllers' organisation or the airport authority but wanted instead to see if it was possible to sue the German federal agencies that gave the orders. The company said that it had to cancel 77 short and medium-distance flights, affecting about 5,000 passengers. Long-haul travellers were not disrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central to the problem was that instead of half an hour, the arrival of President Bush on the German leg of his European tour took the best part of an hour, Lufthansa said. During that time, restrictions were put on planes taxiing, taking off and landing at Frankfurt's Rhein-Main airport. The extra time taken by President Bush and his entourage meant that there was a knock-on effect that led to significant delays. Mr Lamberty said that 92 outgoing flights and 86 income flights were delayed by an average of an hour following President Bush's arrival, affecting almost 17,000 passengers. Despite the problems, Mr Lamberty said that it was not certain that Lufthansa would take legal action.\n",

      "State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos. Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. Legal experts said Rosneft's purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations. \"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,\" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case.

Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.

The firm sought bankruptcy protection in December 2003 after disclosing a 4bn-euro hole in its accounts. Overall, the company's debt is close to 12bn euros, and is falling only slowly. Its brands, well-known in Italy and overseas, have continued to perform strongly, however, and have barely lost revenue since the scandal broke.\n",

On Tuesday, the company's administrator, turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, sued Morgan Stanley, its former banker, to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal. That brought to 49 the number of banks that Mr Bondi has sued, a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros. The company has also sued former auditors and financial advisors for damages. And criminal cases against the company's former management are proceeding separately.\n",

      "China keeps tight rein on credit\n",
      "\n",
      "China's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.\n",

      "Dollar gains on Greenspan speech\n",
      "\n",
      "The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan's speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Worries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an £150m investment in new printing facilities. Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black's Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.\n",

      "\"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,\" he said. \"However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.\" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.\n",

      "\n",
      "Crude oil prices surged back above the $47 a barrel mark on Thursday after an energy market watchdog raised its forecasts for global demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned demand for Opec's crude in the first quarter would outstrip supply. The IEA raised its estimate of 2005 oil demand growth by 80,000 barrels a day to 84 million barrels a day. US light crude rose $1.64 to $47.10, while Brent crude in London gained $1.32 to $44.45.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries. The fresh rally in crude prices followed gains on Wednesday which were triggered by large falls in US crude supplies following a cold spell in North America in January. The US Department of Energy reported that crude stockpiles had fallen 1m barrels to 294.3m. On top of that, ongoing problems for beleaguered Russian oil giant Yukos have also prompted the IEA to revise its output estimates from Russia - a major non-Opec supplier. \"I think that prices are now beginning to set a new range and it looks like the $40 to $50 level,\" said energy analyst Orin Middleton of Barclays Capital.\n",

      "\n",
      "Three Labour councillors in Birmingham were caught operating a \"vote-rigging factory\", an Election Court has heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police found the trio handling unsealed postal ballots in a deserted warehouse in the city during a late-night raid in June 2004, the hearing was told. The votes were later counted towards that month's English local elections. The men, elected to the Aston ward, deny collecting votes fraudulently. The judge presiding has indicated the whole postal voting system is under scrutiny. Deputy High Court Judge Richard Mawrey, QC told the hearing at the Birmingham and Midlands Institute the case could have potentially serious consequences for any forthcoming General Election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The special Election Court, the first in living memory to hear allegations of vote-rigging, opened in Birmingham last month. The case against Muhammad Afzal, Mohammed Islam and Mohammed Kazi is being brought by local Liberal Democrat supporters. They claim the trio benefited from the widespread misuse of postal votes during the 10 June election. Ravi Sukul, counsel for the petitioners, accused the three men of being \"deeply involved\" in illegal practices. Witnesses saw them carrying several bags from their campaign office, which the men drove to a warehouse on an industrial estate off Birch Road East, the court was told.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police were alerted and called to the premises. Mr Sukul said: \"When (the officers) arrived there, in the middle of the night, they saw a large room with a 10ft long table and six Asian men present. \"Hundreds of documents and unsealed envelopes were scattered all over the table.\" The police officers left the warehouse, but were later ordered back to seize the documents. \"When the officers left, all the envelopes and papers were scattered,\" Mr Sukul said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"(When they went) back to make the seizure, every one of these 275 yellow ballot papers were placed neatly in envelope A and sealed. The house was in order.\" Interrupting Mr Sukul in his opening, Mr Mawrey said: \"What you are saying is, these men were operating a vote-forging factory on an industrial estate.\" The court heard how documents were taken by police to the elections office next morning, where they were mixed in with other ballots. The case against the men follows a hearing into postal fraud allegations made against three other Birmingham councillors in the Bordesley Green ward, claims which are denied. Mr Mawrey is due to deliver a judgment in their case once the Aston petition has been heard. Mr Afzal, Mr Islam and Mr Kazi deny conspiring to commit election fraud to deceive the returning officer. The case continues.\n",

      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. He confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues would come at a London conference in March. Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week. The Israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so. He nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BBC's Paul Reynolds says the London conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, who is expected to win the Palestinian presidential election on 9 January. At a news conference following talks with Mr Blair, Mr Abbas said the British prime minister was \"in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit\". He added: \"Your endeavour to hold a conference in London is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose.\" In an interview with the BBC's political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Blair said getting progress between Israelis and Palestinians would be \"tough, but at least we have got the first step\". Mr Blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the Israelis, but said the Israelis were entitled to expect Palestinians to give up terrorism. He argued that Mr Sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from Gaza had to be part of the peace process, not the end of it. Earlier, Mr Sharon again said he had not seen \"the slightest step\" the Palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged Palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. Before visiting Israel, Mr Blair made a surprise visit to Iraq, where he met leaders in Baghdad during his first trip to the city. He was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. He also flew to Basra in southern Iraq where British forces are stationed.\n",

      "UK firm faces Venezuelan land row\n",
      "\n",
      "Venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a British company as part of President Chavez's agrarian reform programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials in Cojedes state said on Friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the Vestey Group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. The government is cracking down on so-called latifundios, or large rural estates, which it says are lying idle. The Vestey Group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm, whose Agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in Venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with Venezuelan law. Prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted Hato El Charcote, a beef cattle ranch owned by Agroflora. According to Reuters, they plan to seize 12,900 acres (5,200 hectares) from the 32,000 acre (13,000 hectare) farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials claim that Agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. They also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. \"The legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus,\" state prosecutor Alexis Ortiz told Reuters. \"As a consequence the government has taken action.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th Century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics say the powers - which President Chavez argues are needed to help the country's poorest citizens and develop the Venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. But a spokesman added: \"Agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land.\" The company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the Venezuelan market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000. The authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had \"nothing to fear\". Under President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy. It recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.\n",

      "\n",
      "Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.\n",

      "Air passengers win new EU rights\n",
      "\n",
      "Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "New EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a \"bad piece of legislation\". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to 'bumping' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to \"extraordinary circumstances\". Airlines fear that \"extraordinary circumstances\" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. \"It's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4's Today programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "EC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were \"grey areas\" but said \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out\". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. \"We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,\" Mr Clarke said. \"That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. \"The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers' right.\" \"This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people's daily lives,\" he added. The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.\n",

      "Ask Jeeves has become the third leading online search firm this week to thank a revival in internet advertising for improving fortunes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm's revenue nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2004, exceeding $86m (£46m). Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player. Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week. During the same quarter, Yahoo earned $187m, again tipping a resurgence in online advertising.\n",

      "The trend has taken hold relatively quickly. Late last year, marketing company Doubleclick, one of the leading providers of online advertising, warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale. But on Thursday, it announced that a sharp turnaround had brought about an unexpected increase in profits. Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however. In both cases, their shares fell by some 4%. Analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters, fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of Google on Tuesday.\n",

      "Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target. Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%. Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of £5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH. Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine. Allied Domecq's big names include Malibu rum, Courvoisier brandy, Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream. The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.\n",

      "\n",
      "British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October, it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.\n",

      "\n",
      "A US government claim accusing the country's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demand for $280bn (£155bn) - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - was rejected in a 2-1 decision. The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. In its case, the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction, targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns, lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business.

      "German telecoms firm Deutsche Telekom saw strong fourth quarter profits on the back of upbeat US mobile earnings and better-than-expected asset sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Net profit came in at 1.4bn euros (£960m; $1.85bn), a dramatic change from the loss of 364m euros in 2003. Sales rose 2.8% to 14.96bn euros. Sales of stakes in firms including Russia's OAO Mobile Telesystems raised 1.17bn euros. This was more than expected and helped to bring debt down to 35.8bn euros.\n",

      "A year ago, debt was more than 11bn euros higher. T-Mobile USA, the company's American mobile business, made a strong contribution to profits. \"It's a seminal achievement that they cut debt so low. That gives them some head room to invest in growth now,\" said Hannes Wittig, telecoms analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The company also said it would resume paying a dividend, after two years in which it focused on cutting debt.\n",

      "Japan narrowly escapes recession\n",
      "\n",
      "Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. \"I maintain the view that Japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. \"It's painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,\" said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.\n",

      "Indonesians face fuel price rise\n",
      "\n",
      "Indonesia's government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Millions of Indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking, and prices have been heavily subsidised for years. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. Millions of people were left homeless in Indonesia Aceh's region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; £3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. Since President Yudhoyono's government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. \"The (January to March) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices,\" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, State Minister for National Development Planning. \"We are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. The sooner the better for the state budget.\" The BBC's correspondent in Jakarta, Rachel Harvey, told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. \"The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,\" she said. Indonesia's previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.\n",

      "Peugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi\n",
      "\n",
      "Struggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV).\n",
      "\n",
      "The two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say they expect to seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.\n",

      "Jobs growth still slow in the US\n",
      "\n",
      "The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The number of people out of work in Europe's largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "German unemployment rose 7,000 in November to 4.464 million people, or 10.8% of the workforce. The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect. But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. \"There are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand,\" said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in a statement. \"But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market.\" High oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect, he said. The brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where the rate is 18.8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda. A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work, paid for by cutting some cherished benefits, has sparked anger among some German workers. Strikes in a number of industries, notably among the country's iconic carmakers, have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold. Among the new initiatives are the so-called \"one-euro jobs\" which top up unemployment benefit. The scheme's formal launch is January, but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics, economists said. \"The deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise,\" said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank. \"Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers.\"\n",

      "US gives foreign firms extra time\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the deadline to get in line with the rules until 15 July 2006. Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. The new rules are the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, part of the US clean-up after corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom. Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules. Big US firms already have to meet the requirements, but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the middle of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past few months, delegations of European and other business leaders have been heading to the SEC's Washington DC headquarters to protest. They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some, particularly the UK's CBI, warned that companies would choose to let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. The latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday, just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced. \"I think this signifies a change of heart at the SEC,\" CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC's Today programme. \"They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation really means: that they can't make these rules in isolation.\" The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries. The European Union, in particular, was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted. \"I don't underestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension will provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look at their internal controls,\" said Donald Nicolaisen, the SEC's chief accountant.\n",

      "EU referendum question unveiled\n",
      "\n",
      "The question to be asked in the referendum on the EU Constitution has been unveiled by the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?\" The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote in the referendum, expected in 2006. Critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal Europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state EU. \"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patriots by definition wanted the UK to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad, Mr Straw said. \"Our role as a leading member of the EU is a crucial part of securing that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\". But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\". Despite this \"underhand trick,\" the referendum bill stood \"no chance of becoming law before the election,\" he added. \"This is Tony Blair's cheap gesture to the pro-constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on Europe he knows he cannot win.\" Neil O'Brien, director of anti-constitution group Vote No, said: \"The reality is that the government doesn't want to discuss the EU constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK Independence Party said: \"If the government believes that a No vote would mean that we should leave the European Union, they should just ask us if we want to leave the EU. Then we can be out of it and better off much sooner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who backs the constitution, said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The sooner we get on with this, the better.\" He said the question sounded \"very neutral\" and \"balanced,\" adding it would enable the argument \"to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides\". Green MEP Caroline Lucas welcomed Tony Blair's \"courage in keeping his word\" on holding a referendum. But she added: \"This treaty is a flawed document that will make the EU less accountable, less sustainable, and less just.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in Rome in November, but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum. That promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties. Jack Straw, who argues the constitution reflected a \"British vision for Europe\" and gives \"national governments a stronger grip\", has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006. But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Blair refused to be pinned down to that date, saying Britain would hold a poll \"some time in 2006 but when, I don't know\". The paper said the prime minister \"claimed ignorance\" of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.\n",

      "Malik rejects all-black MP lists\n",
      "\n",
      "A call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour's most senior Asians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahid Malik, who is on Labour's ruling NEC, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn't have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren't doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn't worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven't ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.\n",

      "Japanese mogul arrested for fraud\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. His is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals. He was taken away in a van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable. Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan's troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.\n",

Also on Friday, France's industrial output for December was released, showing 0.7% growth. \"The numbers are good,\" said David Naude, economist at Deutsche Bank. \"They send a positive signal of a rebound in output... and open the way for a continuation in that trend into the New Year.\" Service sector activity improved in January, hitting a seven-month high.

      "Rank, formerly famous for the Carry On series, will expose the shake-up at the announcement of its results on Friday, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Advisors Goldman Sachs are understood to have valued its demerged Deluxe Film unit at £300m, the report added. Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September. Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios. The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. It also owns Deluxe Media, which makes and distributes DVDs and videos. However, that business is seen as less successful. Last year it made profits of £21.5m on a turnover of £392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to DVDs from VHS video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. A spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on Friday. Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to £170m from £194m last year. Formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading UK film producer and cinema owner for many years. It has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the UK - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. It now owns 34 Grosvenor casinos, the Mecca Bingo chain and more than 100 Hard Rock Cafes in 38 countries.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\n",
      "\n",
      "He acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\n",

      "They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\n",

They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\" Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits.

      "The plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. It was overshadowed by Rwanda's emergence from the 100 days of slaughter, during which time the mass killings took place, and the women's fate was largely a taboo subject. But many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but, in many cases, orphans too.\n",

      "As the women die, the number of Rwanda's orphans rises. Until recently, very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. That is now starting to change. This funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2,500 women. Mary Kayitesi Blewitt, founder of the Survivors Fund (SURF), one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled, said it was a recognition, before it was too late, that the survivors should be a priority for help.\n",

      "India, which attends the G7 meeting of seven leading industrialised nations on Friday, is unlikely to be cowed by its newcomer status.\n",
      "\n",
      "In London on Thursday ahead of the meeting, India's finance minister, lashed out at the restrictive trade policies of the G7 nations. He objected to subsidies on agriculture that make it hard for developing nations like India to compete. He also called for reform of the United Nations, the World Bank and the IMF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palaniappan Chidambaram, India's finance minister, argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order, given India and China's integration into the global economy. He said the issue is not globalisation but \"the terms of engagement in globalisation.\" Mr Chidambaram is attending the G7 meeting as part of the G20 group of nations, which account for two thirds of the world's population. At a conference on developing enterprise hosted by UK finance minister Gordon Brown on Friday, he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks. \"A flexible exchange rate is one more channel for absorbing both positive and negative shocks,\" he told the conference. India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, has been invited to take part in the G7 meeting taking place in London on Friday and Saturday. China is expected to face renewed pressure to abandon its fixed exchange rate, which G7 nations, in particular the US, have blamed for a surge in cheap Chinese exports. \"Some countries have tried to use fixed exchange rates. I do not wish to make any judgements,\" Mr Chidambaram said. Separately, the IMF warned on Thursday that India's budget deficit was too large and would hamper the country's economic growth, which it forecast to be around 6.5% in the year to March 2005. In the year to March 2004, the Indian economy grew by 8.5%.\n",

      "Call centre users 'lose patience'\n",
      "\n",
      "Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using their mobile phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.\n",
      "\n",
      "In what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:\n",
      "\n",
      "- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", \n",
      " - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, \n",
      " - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?\n",

      "\n",
      "In its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world's main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report. \"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\" China's booming economy and a \"spectacular comeback\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\" it added. However, the report warned: \"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone's over-reliance on export-led growth.\n",

      "The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004, latest figures show.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003's imbalance of $496.5bn. The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to £56.4bn. The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China's currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.\n",

Since her abduction, several videos of Mrs Hassan have been broadcast by Al-Jazeera. The latest footage showed Mrs Hassan asking for British troops to be pulled out of Iraq.

      "Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities.

Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.\n",

      "Mr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities. \"I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees,\" he told a Russian court.\n",

      "Yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. It was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group, which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. \"The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia,\" Judge Clark said in her ruling. \"Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government.\" Yukos had argued that a US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston. Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her ruling, the judge acknowledged that \"it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law\".

The US court's jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft, a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft.

      "Mr Clarke said he had made clear the UK would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system. And only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted. \"Under our plans we expect unfounded applications to continue to fall,\" he added. Earlier, Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about Tory policies and then attacking the lies. He told BBC Radio: \"If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all.\" The latest pre-election spats come after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a \"hard right agenda\" which would take Britain backwards.

      "'Nuclear dumpsite' plan attacked\n",
      "\n",
      "Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded \"deeply irresponsible\" by the Liberal Democrats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK. The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a \"nuclear dumpsite\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a \"sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries\". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to £680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: \"I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fears have been confirmed. \"Once again Britain's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI. \"This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the £48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. \"The Energy Act was supposed to help Britain clean up, but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. \"The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial has withdrawn its takeover offer for rival bank UFJ Holdings, enabling the latter to merge with Mitsubishi Tokyo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sumitomo bosses told counterparts at UFJ of its decision on Friday, clearing the way for it to conclude a 3 trillion yen ($29bn) deal with Mitsubishi. The deal would create the world's biggest bank with assets of about 189 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion). Sumitomo's exit ends the most high profile fight in Japanese bank history.\n",
      "\n",
      "UFJ Holdings, Japan's fourth-largest bank, has been at the centre of a fierce bid battle over the last year. Sumitomo, Japan's third-largest bank, tabled a higher offer for UFJ than its rival, valuing the company at $35bn.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, UFJ's management was known to prefer the offer from Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG), Japan's second-largest bank. Concerns were also raised about Sumitomo's ability to absorb UFJ and the former has now admitted defeat. \"We believe the market and most investors accept a UFJ-MTFG merger,\" Sumitomo said in a statement. \"Given the ongoing integration of UFJ and MTFG operations, persisting with our proposal may not be in the best interests of our shareholders or UFJ's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mitsubishi's takeover of UFJ - which will be Japan's largest-ever takeover deal - will still have to be approved by shareholders of the two firms. However, this is expected to be a formality. Sumitomo may now turn its attention to deepening its ties with Daiwa Securities, another Japanese financial firm. The two are set to merge their venture capital operations and there has been speculation that this could lead to a full-blown merger.

      "\n",
      "The world's biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the largest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs). This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.\n",

      "Labour's 'EU propaganda'\n",
      "\n",
      "A \"taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise\" on the EU is being used to lull the British public into a false sense of security, say the Tories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution. His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of \"running scared\" of debate. EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Straw used Thursday's Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005. Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw. Africa and climate change would also feature highly. He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe's economic output and were spent \"where it adds most value\". Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was \"fully justified\". \"We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Ancram condemned the document, which the Foreign Office says has cost about £2,500 to design, print and deliver. \"Isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?,\" he asked. The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand. \"The government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this 'easy and simple' constitution to the British people,\" he said. \"Who are they trying to kid?\" The proposed question for the constitution referendum is: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?\" The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the Tories set to campaign for a \"no\" vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a \"level playing field\" on immigration and asylum controls. \"You are setting your face against all of these things,\" he added. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued. Sir Menzies was among those worried about plans, backed by the UK, to lift the arms embargo imposed on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken - Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.\n",

      "Tories 'would cut number of MPs'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservative Party would cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan forms part of the party's \"smaller government bill\", to be unveiled later this week. Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. And he said a referendum would be held in Wales to decide whether or not to scrap the Welsh Assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. If Wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more MPs. Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. \"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers?\" he said. Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: \"This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people's lives by reducing the size and role of the State\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the \"great unfairness\" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England. The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said. In Northern Ireland it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000. The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was \"consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom\" if the assembly was scrapped. Mr Howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next. \"You have got to have a big bang. We don't want this like the House of Lords reform, getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that allowing huge US budget deficits to continue could have \"severe\" consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes. While the US economy is growing at a \"reasonably good pace\" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US. Pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires. \"I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,\" Mr Greenspan said. He also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity \"retirement and health programmes would need \"significant\" changes. He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs. Since President George W Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year.\n",

      "\n",
      "The South African government has put tax cuts and increased social spending at the centre of its latest budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country's poor, finance minister Trevor Manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was \"more for all\". The tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; £910m). Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. Spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. All the spending increases will run over the next three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%.\n",
      "\n",
      "He predicted that the South African economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. Mr Manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,\" said Mr Manuel. He said that the economic situation was a \"marked improvement\" on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. About 280,000 jobs a year have been created in South Africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high, currently close to 30%. Economist Colen Garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth. \"It's pleasant to see the cut in company taxes, it's a good incentive for business,\" he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "US aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 777-200LR will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop, linking cities such as London and Sydney. Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing's twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. But the 777-200LR \"is a niche player\", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. It has been producing a rival to Boeing's 777 line for more than a year. \"Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said Flight International's Mr Learmount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. These orders should help underpin the company's profits. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract. Net profit was $186m (£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Foreign Office says 41 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the Tsunami which struck south Asia on Boxing Day, with 158 others missing. Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives.\" The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the £50m given by the government so far only \"six or seven million\" had been spent. It would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in. \"My estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. So we will far and away more than match the generosity of the British people,\" he said. Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery. \"As you can see unfortunately I am still looking the same as I always did,\" he joked.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hospital waiting times for patients in Wales are to be cut, but not to the same extent as those in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Welsh Health Minister Jane Hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by March 2006, against a current target of 18 months. But she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for March 2006. The announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop. This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the New Year. In England, the current target for inpatients - seeing a consultant to having an operation - is six months. Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), welcomed the new targets \"to make further and faster progress on waiting lists\". \"However, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because Wales still lags a long way behind England,\" he said. \"Capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that Welsh patients don't receive a worse service than patients over the border.\" Health analyst Tony Beddow, from the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care, called the new targets \"reasonably impressive\".\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced £264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting \"unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year\". \"We are turning the corner on long waits in Wales. Now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again,\" she said. She added the targets intended to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant. \"But let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months, and these targets affect the small minority of patients in Wales that are waiting far too long.\" Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Plaid Cymru health spokesman said: \"It's exactly the same target she set in 1999, with the qualification that it's dependent on a second offer. It's a failed target, from a failed minister..with a failed policy.\" For the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Kirsty Williams called the new target \"hugely unambitious\". \"It leaves patients in Wales still waiting two years before they're treated.\" Conservative health spokesman Jonathan Morgan said: \"We're spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof. \"The Audit Commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively, and that's quite a criticism.\" Meanwhile, the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in Wales has fallen by 9.8%. Statistics to the end of November showed a decline since October from 785 to 708. The number waiting over 12 months also fell from 7,613 to 6,630, or 12.9%. Ms Hutt said they were \"excellent figures\". There are 305,775 people on a waiting list of some kind, down from 311,764 last month.\n",

      "A government-commissioned study ranked the UK third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ICT). The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. Mr O'Brien said UK businesses were sprinting forward in ICT use, but that there were more challenges ahead. The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.\n",
      "\n",
      "It showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. Mr O'Brien said: \"The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring. \"It is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years.\" The government would play its part in \"cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish\", Mr O'Brien said. The \"clear message\" the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the UK is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy,\" he added.

      "But Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said Harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person. \"There is a reservoir of goodwill for Prince Harry, and Prince William with him, in this country, but I think he needs to remember that it can't last forever.\" He added that Sandhurst would probably be good for Harry as it would teach him some self discipline. Former Labour MP Lord Janner, who is a high profile member of Britain's Jewish community, branded Harry's action's \"stupid and evil\". He told ITV: \"The time has come for him to make a public apology. It is about common decency, of respect to the people who fought the Nazis, to the families of those who were killed by the Nazis and to people who suffered during the Holocaust.\" He added: \"I would send him in the army as fast as possible. I hope that would teach him not to behave like that.\"\n",

      "A photograph of Prince Harry wearing a swastika armband and German desert uniform at the party appears in Thursday's Sun newspaper under the headline: \"Harry the Nazi.\" Mr Howard acknowledged the prince's apology and said he had no doubt the prince's father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is.\" Mr Howard declined to say what form the statement should take. But former Buckingham Palace press spokesman Dicky Arbiter said the prince should make a personal, broadcast apology. Mr Clarke said he recognised people's concerns about the costume but argued: \"He has apologised and I think we should leave the matter there.\"\n",

      "Ban on hunting comes into force\n",
      "\n",
      "Fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in England and Wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the Countryside Alliance saying many hunts will be out in force. Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. He said police would challenge the \"one of two isolated hunts\" which are threatening to break the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. \"The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. \"You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. He has rejected a \"blanket policy\" of not enforcing the ban until the House of Lords has considered its legality. John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. He said police had \"acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. Under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to \"flush out\" foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. \"We are not going away. We will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again,\" hunt master, Captain Ian Farquhar, said. But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that \"people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about\". He said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting. \"Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting,\" he said.\n",

      "India seeks to boost construction\n",
      "\n",
      "India has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamal Nath, Commerce and Industry Minister, announced the decision in Delhi on Thursday following a cabinet meeting. Analysts say improving India's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. The Indian government's decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean \"better offerings\" for consumers as well as builders. He said the firm will benefit from world class \"strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumers will have better choice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. The automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which can be bureaucratic. The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. \"Foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,\" said Mr Nath, without specifying the timeframe. Previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market. This measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. Anshuman Magazine, managing director, of CB Richard Ellis - an international real estate company - told the BBC this was \"a big positive step.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said allowing FDI in the country is compromising India's own \"self reliance\". He said, \"No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.\" Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.\n",

      "\n",
      "The company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. By 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. The new plant will be built close to the existing one in Chennai, in the southern province of Tamil Nadu.\n",
      "\n",
      "South Korea's top car maker estimates that the Indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. Demand in India has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. \"We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,\" chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement. He said the company plans to use India as a base for exports to Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The company - which controls half of the South Korean's market - aims to become a global top five auto maker by 2010.\n",

      "Pre-tax profit for 2004 was £15.4m ($29.4m). Umbro, which recently lost sponsorship deals with Chelsea and Celtic, said on Thursday it had signed a new four-year agreement with Scottish club Rangers. It hopes 2005 sales will benefit from the launch of a new England replica shirt ahead of the 2006 World Cup. In January, Umbro announced its sponsorship agreement with Chelsea, which gave Umbro the lucrative right to make replica shirts, would end in 2006, five years earlier than expected. The firm, which is to receive a payment from Chelsea of £24.5m, said it is \"appraising a number of additional investment opportunities as a result of this compensation\" .

      "\n",
      "Deals are being sought to allow the UK to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home Secretary Charles Clarke told the Times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. The move follows a Law Lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison, London, and Woodhill, Milton Keynes, was unlawful. The 12 affected by the ruling are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Clarke told The Times: \"I think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.\" He said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw \"in a very positive way\". Mr Clarke said that he was seeking \"memorandums of understanding\" between overseas governments and Britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. However, he added: \"I do not think the solution to the Law Lords' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. \"There are other strands that we have to do.\" But the Liberal Democrat's shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,\" he told BBC News. \"And I do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included,\" Mr Oaten said. \"Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.\" \"Unless we get that, the Liberal Democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in March.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The BBC's home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett. But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult. \"Some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so it's not an easy agreement to get and I think for some of these suspects it won't be the solution.\" Daniel Sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks. \"The government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial,\" he said.\n",

      "Former Conservative leader William Hague says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Hague, 43, told the Daily Telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too \"boring\" and unfulfilling. Mr Hague, who stepped down after his party's 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench. He also told the paper he hopes to remain MP for Richmond, North Yorks, and start a family with wife Ffion. Mr Hague, who recently had published the biography of William Pitt the Younger, also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.\n",

Tim Collins, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a \"huge boost\" to the party if Mr Hague returned to the front bench. Mr Hague became an MP at 27 and Leader of the Opposition at 36. He said: \"I feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, I had crammed in an entire political career. \"I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling.\" Mr Hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister. \"Maybe I wasn't as driven by politics as I thought I was,\" he said.\n",

      "Gordon Brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and Tony Blair was harming the workings of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonathan Baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of \"competing agendas\" between Mr Brown and Mr Blair. But the chancellor said Mr Baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. He said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members' jobs. It suited the purpose of Mr Baume's union, the First Division Association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the plans, unveiled in the Gershon report, some 84,000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services. Mr Brown said: \"To be honest I don't think you can rely on his [Mr Baume's] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. \"Mr Blair and I are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms. We are determined to go on with the Gershon reforms.\" He also said that as Mr Baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge. On Wednesday, ahead of the Chancellor's pre-Budget report, Mr Baume told BBC News there were sometimes \"conflicting and competing agendas for government\" between Number 10 and the Treasury.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the chancellor wanted was \"not by any means what Alan Milburn and the prime minister want to see\", Mr Baume said. \"Government departments get their money from the Treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that's not necessarily the same as the Treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. \"He also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda. \"The problem is that on many occasions these two don't add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle.\" Number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a \"soap opera\" about Mr Blair and Mr Brown. Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"The battle Royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and Tony Blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money.\"\n",

      "The Tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce ID cards.\n",

      "The shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's Commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory ID.

The bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the Liberal Democrats.\n",

      "They have said the scheme is \"deeply flawed\" and a waste of money. Sources within the Conservative Party told the BBC Michael Howard has always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. The party has been \"agnostic\" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said. Despite giving their backing to ID cards, the Conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. \"It will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards. \"The Tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.\" The new chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere?

UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions.

The Lib Dems warned both parties against \"pandering to prejudice\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. \"It's very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Government figures suggest TB in England has increased by 25% over the past 10 years. \"Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad,\" said Mr Howard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.\" But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants' claims. The proposals include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a \"high incidence TB country\" will have to undergo a chest X-ray. \n",
      " - People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to \"demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health\". \n",
      " - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to \"impose significant costs or demands\" on the NHS. \n",
      " - The tests will include a health check, chest X-rays for TB (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and HIV for over 16-year-olds. Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a \"case by case basis\".\n",

      "There is already some screening in place. Last year 185,000 people were tested for TB at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, only about 200 were found to be infected.

Immigration minister Des Browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying: \"We are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage. \"Those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK.\" Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives. \"Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one.\" Lisa Power, head of policy at Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based. \"In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status,\" she said.\n",

But Human Rights Watch says the EU is putting commerce above abuse concerns.\n",

      "In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. Germany and France have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious but Mr Straw last week said he also wanted it to end, despite US objections.\n",
      "\n",
      "He expects it to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics. Brad Adams, from Human Rights Watch, said: \"This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square. \"There are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma. The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said. And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. \"The code of conduct is much more effective, it's a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten. The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said. Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the move would be \"profoundly wrong\". The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban.\n",

Tom Heap, BBC rural affairs correspondent, said it appeared that hunstman had, for now, been sticking to the new rules. And while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on Saturday, he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before riding out with the hunt, former minister Kate Hoey told crowds: \"We will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.\" Judith Moritz, in Melton Mowbray, said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of Leicestershire, but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. The Countryside Alliance said the meets would show the new law was \"impossibly difficult to determine\" and open to different interpretations.\n",

      "Chief executive Simon Hart said: \"There has been hunting in England for 700 years. This [ban] may take two or three years, perhaps two or three months, to unpick. \"It will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service, as broadcasters say.\" Conservative family spokeswoman Theresa May said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. Suffolk Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rural policing, told the BBC the law would be enforced, although the police would not break up hunts. The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. He said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.\n",

      "\n",
      "The move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to working women. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. But progress has been slow, reports from the country say.\n",

      "Earlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi had \"caused uproar\" when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices.

Women now make up more than half of all graduates from Saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce. \"Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society,\" Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying. \"I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.\"\n",

      "Economy 'stronger than forecast'\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\n",
      "\n",
      "A slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"\n",

      "'More to do' on adult literacy\n",
      "\n",
      "The government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Audit Office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in England gaining basic qualifications by this year. But a target of 1.5 million more by 2010 needed \"creative\" ideas. Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the report, \"more than half\" the qualifications achieved were by learners aged 16 to 18. These are defined as \"adults\" by the government for the purpose of compiling these figures. Normally adults are defined as being aged over 19. The number of these people gaining qualifications was \"rising slowly\". Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: \"Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. \"More people will have the opportunity to live richer lives.\" In 2001, the government launched the Get On scheme - aimed at reducing illiteracy and innumeracy. Sir John said \"substantial progress\" had been made since, adding that this was \"only the beginning\". The government and its partners would \"need to be creative and responsive\". Some £3.7bn will be spent on implementing the programme by 2006. The report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand. Existing adult learners could use their \"enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge\" to attract other people. The Department for Education and Skills could also use more \"personalised learning\" and work with voluntary groups, councils and employers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should also assess adult learners' progress \"at frequent intervals\", the report adds. When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was \"only the start of the journey\". An estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level. This is thought to cost the UK economy hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government's scheme range up to GCSE equivalents. Get On's participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010, with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007. Education minister Ivan Lewis said: \"We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace.\" Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: \"This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour's failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life. \"Employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of school-leavers without these basic skills, but all the government have offered is more talk.\" Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis added: \"Far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Scotland's first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk \"once in a while\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Jack McConnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. He has been criticised by the SNP for encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". The first minister's comments came in a question and answer session at Glenurquhart High School in Inverness, attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. A Highland councillor who was at the event has also defended Mr McConnell. Margaret Davidson, the independent member for the Loch Ness West, said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When one pupil asked Mr McConnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking, began his response with the quip: \"I'm sure there's no under-age drinking in the Highlands.\" He went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. He said: \"I hope I'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them.\" Mr McConnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking. \"The one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that,\" he said. \"Far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. \"We are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He added: \"By all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly.\" SNP Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon said: \"This is an incredible gaffe by Jack McConnell. \"We all know that under-age drinking is an issue in Scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the First Minister, should encourage young people to get drunk. \"The first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately.\" But an executive spokeswoman insisted Mr McConnell had made the remark with adults, not youngsters, in mind. \"He was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s,\" she said. \"It was just a recognition that people will get drunk, but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Experts are giving evidence on the subject to the Scottish Parliament's environment committee. Officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming. Solutions suggested by conservationists include reducing internal UK air travel and boosting electric trains. The evidence is part of the committee's inquiry into the impact of climate change in Scotland. Sepa is attempting to curb global warming gases, as pollution from transport emissions increases.\n",

      "Ecologists are warning MSPs that Scotland may have to accept \"significant intrusion\" from wind farms. It is likely also that nuclear power will be needed for possibly several decades.

      "Public and Commercial Services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 November. The TUC said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the £22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. General secretary Brendan Barber warned the \"costs could easily outweigh the benefits\". \"The government's big boost to public spending is now showing results,\" said Mr Barber. \"Public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy.\n",

      "\"They may shoot a Tory fox, but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. The costs could easily outweigh the benefits.\" Next Friday's strike action by the PCS is the biggest in the civil service since 1993, hitting Jobcentres, benefit agencies, pensions offices, customs and driving tests. The union says it is concerned about pensions, sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. Last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and Jobcentres across the UK would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. The number of civil servants in Britain rose to more than 520,000 in April. Other areas the strike will affect include passports, museums and galleries, libraries and health and safety inspections.\n",

      "\n",
      "The company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from £3.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to £2.89bn in 2004. Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to £198m from the £130m seen a year earlier. Reuters also beat its savings target for 2004, delivering £234m of cuts. Under its three-year Fast Forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save £220m during the 12 months to 31 December.\n",

      "Reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to £160m from £610m a year earlier. The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected \"further gradual improvement\" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales. It added it was planning to deliver a further £105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an £80m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf. \"Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005,\" chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning \"to look beyond recovery to growth\".\n",

      "\n",
      "It also has an option for a further 70 aircraft, a move which brings the Ryanair/Boeing order book up to 225 firm orders and options on 193 more. Ryanair said the new planes would help it to cut operating costs further. The carrier reported a drop in quarterly profit earlier this year after it was hit by higher fuel costs. However, when it reported the results, the airline was upbeat about prospects for 2005, despite tough competition in the budget airline market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryanair chairman David Bonderman said that the 737-800 had \"significantly reduced our unit operating costs and allowed us to reduce air fares each year for the last five years\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With this new order and new pricing in place, Ryanair expects that unit operating costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five years,\" he added. At the end of this year, Ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new planes, while the 70 new orders are due for delivery between 2008 and 2012. The airline said that when all these planes have been delivered, it will be able to carry more than 70 million passengers a year, making it Europe's largest airline. About 2,500 new jobs should be created in the next seven years, it added. The order can be seen as good news for Boeing, which in recent years has been overtaken by European plane maker Airbus as the world's biggest-selling plane maker.\n",

      "\n",
      "Next year will be \"make or break\" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria. The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His proposals were effectively a new \"Marshall Plan\" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. Agreement in the Doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed, he argued. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. But with 30,000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed, including 100% debt relief multilaterally. \"That is why next year is a test,\" he said. \"If after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them, then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results.\" The Catholic aid agency Cafod will host Mr Brown's speech on Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cafod wants Britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the US to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. Oxfam's Paying the Price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. The charity's director, Barbara Stocking, said: \"2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure.\" The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "But 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a \"scar\" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing \"guff\" about scars on the world. It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added. Conservative shadow international development secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million Africans by 2005. Instead, only 500,000 people would benefit, he said. \"There's no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has,\" added Mr Duncan.\n",

Meanwhile Labour backbencher Stephen Pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes \"a pile of pants\". The MP for Ealing North claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on BBC Radio 4. \"You look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate Blackpool.

Ms Jowell insisted: \"We have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing.\" And continued: \"We can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. I intend to keep it that way.\" Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday.

      "The \"myth that ageing is a barrier\" to contributing to society needs to be \"exploded\", the work and pensions minister has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was why the government was considering scrapping the retirement age entirely, Alan Johnson said. It was also committed to \"stamping out\" age discrimination and would outlaw it, he told a conference on ageing. All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson told Age Concern's Age Agenda in London the government was \"seriously considering\" introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. This idea has been adopted by the Lib Dems as policy, while the Tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions. Mr Johnson's speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country's pension system. This would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women, he said. Speaking at the London conference he said: \"Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were \"increasingly consigned to the past\". \"We're sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and we're giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously. \"And the review in 2011, which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely, is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded\". Mr Johnson said his department had a long-term aspiration of moving towards an 80% employment rate. This would involve an extra one million older people joining the work force, he said.\n",

Mr Blair is at a summit in Brussels, where Iraq and European justice and immigration plans are on the agenda. French President Jacques Chirac reacted to his warning by saying Europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity. Mr Blair has probably been closer to President Bush than any other European leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said some people were in \"a sort of state of denial\" about the US election result but predicted a more \"receptive mood\" would emerge soon. America needed to listen to the world too, he said. \"The fact is that President Bush is there for four years. He is there because the American people have chosen him,\" he argued. He also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain was \"uniquely placed\" to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the US, he suggested. He admitted he had gone to bed at 2230GMT, well before the American polls closed, thinking Mr Kerry might have won. He woke up at 0530GMT to discover Mr Bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result. His words about President Bush met a cool reception from Jacques Chirac. The French president told reporters: \"Europe today has more than ever the need, the necessity, to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity. \"That is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multi-polar than ever.\"\n",

Mr Chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the United Arab Emirates' late leader and says he would be happy to meet Mr Allawi. He also signed a communiqu&#233; stressing the EU's commitment to securing a stable and unified Iraq. The EU also confirmed a new $21m aid package. The communiqu&#233; congratulated President Bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations. The summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline European asylum and immigration decisions. Mr Blair recently said the UK would only participate in EU-wide measures where it was in UK interests but the Tories say he is surrendering a key veto. The meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in Lisbon in 2000 to make Europe more competitive.\n",

      "Analysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions. Although inventories fell 0.7% month on month, they were 36% higher than a year ago. \"It's a sign that the economy's adjustment phase is stronger than expected,\" said Takashi Yamanaka, an economist with UFJ Bank.

Experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. \"The outlook for November is positive so I don't think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in October,\" said a METI official.

      "Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome.\n",
      "\n",
      "He will present an \"Action Plan for the Development of Italy\" in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. Also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 GMT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government has been accused of underfunding R&D, making it harder for Italy to compete with other European nations and leading to a \"brain-drain\" of the country's brightest talents. Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. As a result, they say, Italy's corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. At the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy's entrepreneurial spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy's 60 million population. According to Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy's business newspaper, the government will focus on \"opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; £4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. He has also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. Italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility Enel. Critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make Italy's problems worse. Limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country has been one of the eurozone's worst economic performers in recent years. Growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. At the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from Italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy's economy to a juddering halt. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy's economy.\n",

      "UK's 'useless' quangos under fire\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers' cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other's efforts, a report claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essential Guide to British Quangos 2005 author Dan Lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since Labour won power in 1997. He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. Tories and Lib Dems welcomed the report and called for a \"slimming down\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Conservative deregulation spokesman John Redwood said: \"The research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos, and slimming down the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Conservative government will axe 162 quangos, as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government.\" Lib Dem spokesman Ed Davey meanwhile said instead of the \"bonfire of quangos\" New Labour had promised, there had been an \"explosion\" of them. \"For over two decades, under both Tory and Labour governments, these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed. \"Liberal Democrats would abolish many, merge others, and make any that remain properly accountable.\" Labour representatives were unavailable for comment. The quango guide follows last year's government-commissioned Gershon Report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost £1.8bn a year - cash he says which \"appears to be almost entirely wasted\". As well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. He also listed what he dubbed the nine \"most useless quangos\". They were the British Potato Council, the Milk Development Council, the Energy Savings Trust, Agricultural Wages Committees, the Wine Standards Board, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Football Licensing Authority, Investors in People UK and the Economic and Social Research Council. Mr Lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee Potato Council, set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets, \"surprising\". He said the £80m spent annually on the Energy Savings Trust, which promotes renewable energy, would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for British homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he argued it was \"absurd\" to charge farmers for Agricultural Wages Committees, which set working and wage standards in the industry, when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £1 an hour. \"If a football team can afford to pay £27m for Wayne Rooney, why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the Football Licensing Authority to the tune of over £1.1m a year?\" Mr Lewis asked. The report is published by the Efficiency in Government Unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the Economic Research Council and the Centre for Policy Studies. It says before a new public body is set up, an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.\n",

      "Vouchers 'to cut winter deaths'\n",
      "\n",
      "Pensioners are being promised energy savings by the Liberal Democrats, as snow and cold temperatures continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party says the plans could save the average pensioner £100 every year and cut winter deaths. The government gives £200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60, or £300 where people are over 80. The Tories promise to keep the payments. The Lib Dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey said: \"The current scheme has helped some older people, but this new Liberal Democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year.\" The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. The plan would boost energy conservation, says the party - and insulation could save £100 every year for pensioner households, so using the money more \"intelligently\" than at present.\n",

      "Howard unveils Tory asylum plans\n",
      "\n",
      "Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. Some charities say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\" He said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that \"firm but fair\" immigration controls were essential for good community relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " - Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers \n",
      " - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents \n",
      " - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for \"national security\" \n",
      " - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps. Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough. The plans would help achieve a \"substantial reduction\" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure. He said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current \"unfair and inhumane\" system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum,\" Mr Howard said. \"By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans \"dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible\". Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not think Mr Howard intended to centre the debate about race. But he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. Mr Howard called that suggestion \"disgraceful\".\n",

      "Kennedy calls for Iraq exit plans\n",
      "\n",
      "Tony Blair should set out a proper exit strategy from Iraq in the wake of next Sunday's elections in the country, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a speech focusing on issues arising from the re-election of George W Bush, Mr Kennedy said Iraq had become a \"crucible of militant terrorism\". He wants to see a phased withdrawal of UK troops \"as soon as the situation allows\", he said in London. Any exit strategy must \"augment and support\" the democratic process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,\" he said. \"There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.\" Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal \"regardless of the situation on the ground\".\n",
      "\n",
      "He accused Mr Blair's government of \"being less than straightforward\" over its plans. \"Next week the prime minister should make a statement regarding the elections in Iraq,\" Mr Kennedy said during his City of London speech. \"He should set out a proper exit strategy, including the phased withdrawal of British troops, as the security situation allows.\" Mr Kennedy also argued that British troops deployed in Iraq should be replaced with forces from other countries - \"especially Islamic countries\".\n",

      "Asylum children to face returns\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial scheme, which could start in weeks, may be extended to apply to children from other countries. Children's charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. But the Home Office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These children automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities. Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the \"best interest\" of a child in their care. Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,\" she said. \"We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania]. 'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.\" In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing \"the difficult issue\" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children \"and leave them to rot\". \"We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,\" said the spokesman. \"We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities.\" The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations. Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said. But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. \"From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,\" said Mr Hogg. \"In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. \"The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.\" A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.\n",

      "Japan economy slides to recession\n",
      "\n",
      "The Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters. The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. On Wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips Japan into recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "A previous estimate of 0.1% growth between July and September was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figures released by the government's Cabinet Office showed that GDP, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. However, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. \"The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,\" said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka. Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. \"The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone,\" Mr Takenaka stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan's largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. Japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. However, the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. \"The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn't be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,\" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. Japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.\n",

      "Bad weather hits Nestle sales\n",
      "\n",
      "A combination of bad weather, rising raw material costs and the sluggish European economy has hit sales at Swiss food and drink giant Nestle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue dipped 1.4% to 86.7bn Swiss francs ($74.6bn; £39.1bn) in 2004 as sales of ice cream and mineral water were dampened by the wet summer. However, Nestle's profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream. Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth. Nestle added that it had performed strongly in Africa and Asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability. Nestle's total earnings before interest remained broadly flat over the past year, despite the company managing to boost profit margins. As well as increasing its dividend, Nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn Swiss francs ($861m; £451m). Looking forward, Nestle forecasts organic earnings growth of about 5% in 2005, although it warned that trading would remain just as competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncertainty remains over the future of Perrier, the iconic French mineral water owned by Nestle. Perrier has been locked in a long-standing dispute with unions about productivity levels at the business, which has lead Nestle to consider selling the firm. \"The option of selling is Perrier is still on the table,\" chief executive Peter Brabeck-Letmathe confirmed on Thursday.\n",

      "Bid to cut court witness stress\n",
      "\n",
      "New targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in England and Wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates' courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. More video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. It is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs' plan, Lord Falconer said: \"One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims. \"The needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Courts, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first, without compromising the rights of the defendant.\" He went on: \"Giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience, especially when you're a victim. \"Yet with a will and with support it can be done.\" Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. Other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts. \"You are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence,\" he said. \"But you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, it's not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday. Ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the Lords have over-ruled this. Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament. The person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the House of Lords, he said, and should be the best person chosen from either House of Parliament. What they did, not what they were called, was the critical issue, he added.\n",

      "Blair told to double overseas aid\n",
      "\n",
      "Tony Blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries' debt and double aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels, Oxfam says in a report, Paying the Price. The call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the G8 of top industrialised nations. \"As rich countries get richer, they're giving less and less. This scandal must stop,\" Oxfam's Barbara Stocking said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The world's poorest children are paying for rich countries' policies in aid and debt with their lives. \"2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure,\" the charity's director added. The report said: \"For rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity.\" It also points out that in 1970 the G8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. But 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says.\n",
      "\n",
      "It argues that the price of not investing in poor countries' sustainable development will be felt across the world. The report said: \"Global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. \"Environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. Poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest. \"New threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities. \"Criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the prime minister and Chancellor Gordon Brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a \"scar\" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic. Mr Brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to Britain by the world's poor nations. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said: \"The government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. \"If Britain's proposal for an International Finance Facility were adopted, the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier, by 2008-09. \"These additional resources will be used to increase UK bilateral aid to Africa to at least £1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least £1.5bn on HIV/Aids related work over the next three years.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The new health minister for Wales says there are lessons to learn from England in tackling waiting lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr Brian Gibbons, on his first full day in the job after Jane Hutt was sacked, admitted \"big challenges\" but insisted the \"essentials\" were in place. But both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats said Dr Gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile Ms Hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were \"only 10% of the health agenda. Dr Gibbons, who was a GP in Blaengwynfi, in the Upper Afan Valley, before becoming AM for Aberavon, said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after \"tremendous change and reform\". One of the biggest problems which had faced Ms Hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in Wales.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November the British Medical Association said NHS staff were \"weeping with despair\" as figures showed 311,000 people were waiting for treatment in Wales, up by 2,400 on the previous month. In the same month lists in England were at their lowest for 17 years, with 856,600 people waiting for treatment. Dr Gibbons told Radio Wales: \"There is no doubt that, in managing waiting lists, England has done a lot of very very useful work, and we do need to learn from that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he said the NHS in Wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health, and a balanced view of priorities was important. \"We do need a consistent across-the-board approach, recognising the patients' experience of how they use the service is going to be, at the end of the day, the main test of how the service is working.\" He said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after \"tremendous change and reform\". Later, Dr Gibbons praised the work of Ms Hutt, saying he \"agreed with everything she's done\" to change the health service in Wales. Dr Gibbons said he accepted there was a problem, but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor. He also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out, the rest of the assembly government's health policy would be overshadowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition members and some Labour MPs had long called for Ms Hutt's removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times. First Minister Rhodri Morgan told BBC Wales he had agreed with Ms Hutt in 2003 that she would not be health minister in the run-up to the 2007 elections. \"She's been doing the job for five years and eight months and, apart from Nye Bevan himself, (architect of the NHS), I don't think anybody has ever done the job for so long.\" Mr Morgan said he had only told Ms Hutt of the reshuffle on Monday morning, and said the NHS in Wales was Dr Gibbons' \"baby\" now. In response to Dr Gibbons' comments, Ieuan Wyn Jones, leader of the Plaid Cymru group in the assembly, said: \"It is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking Titanic.\" Kisrty Williams, for the Lib Dems, added: \"If the underlying policy is going to continue, then changing the minister will serve no purpose, other than to deflect flak from Labour's MPs,\" she said. Meanwhile Ms Hutt said she hoped \"that the people of Wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months\" Asked about waiting lists, she said that waiting times and lists were \"only 10% of the health agenda\" and that the Welsh Assembly Government had \"turned the corner\" on the issue.\n",

      "UKIP candidate suspended\n",
      "\n",
      "Eurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. But he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the British Empire, were sent to two Scottish newspapers. UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said those who selected Mr Houston knew nothing of his views. The episode comes at a difficult time for UKIP, soon after the high-profile departure of MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be \"made available to law-abiding members of the community\" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. The document reportedly said: \"We're looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. \"The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do.\" Mr Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston's reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not.

      "Peace protestors have lost a landmark appeal over police actions in stopping an anti-war demonstration days after the start of the Iraq war.\n",

      "They had appealed against a High Court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn protestors away near RAF Fairford, Glos, in 2003. The police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. Sitting on Wednesday, three Appeal Court judges dismissed both appeals. They were challenging decisions by two judges in the High Court in February this year. It followed action by police, when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to RAF Fairford and forced to return to London under police escort. The demonstrators appealed against a finding by Lord Justice May and Mr Justice Harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police were urging Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices Clarke and Rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors' human rights by detaining them in the coaches. Craig Mackey, assistant chief constable of Gloucestershire Police, said: \"We have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence.\" He said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour, a smoke bomb and five shields. \"Given these circumstances, and the fact that RAF Fairford, and other military installations in the UK, had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident, the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches. \"From day one we have vigorously defended this decision, which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at RAF Fairford.\" Fairford Coach Action, representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions, say they are prepared to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Their action is supported by Amnesty International and Liberty.\n",

      "\n",
      "Distinguished lawyer Lord Scarman, who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 Brixton riots, has died aged 93.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career, serving as Law Commission chairman in its first seven years. He also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in Northern Ireland. Paying tribute, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said Lord Scarman was one of the \"great advocates of our generation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His legacy from his decisions in the Lords and the Court of Appeal is substantial. \"His work in the wake of the Brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A great judge, a great lawyer and a great man.\" Lord Scarman's nephew George Ritchie said the peer, who passed away peacefully on Wednesday, would be \"sadly missed\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, who is the most senior judge in England and Wales, said it was Lord Scarman's \"pioneering work\" which paved the way for the Human Rights Act 1998. \"He was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature, and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society,\" he said. \"He was, personally, totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the president of the Family Justice Division, said Lord Scarman was a \"good and humane judge\" and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. Lord Scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in Brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. During the following three days of disturbances that spread to the Midlands, Merseyside, Bristol and Leeds, nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inquiry famously settled on the so-called \"rotten apples\" theory, which argued that only a few police officers were racist, saying most were not. It spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the Police Complaints Authority. Trevor Phillips, chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, praised Lord Scarman's \"ability to listen\". He said: \"When Lord Scarman toured the streets of Brixton his presence was electrifying. \"A community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the English establishment. \"His great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds, many of whose language he could barely understand, genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings. \"He never lost the special combination of wisdom, humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the Brixton riots.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of Fiat's carmaking operations, the Financial Times has reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "It said Fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; £1.05bn) settlement with GM about Fiat's ownership. Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together, it said. Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat's car business is making a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. It considered floating Ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to Italian bank Mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). That sale valued Ferrari - which owns the Maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. Such a move would help Alfa Romeo and Maserati to share marketing, distribution and research & development costs. Maserati and Ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiat, Italy's largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes. Fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with General Motors. The US firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy Fiat outright. Analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which Fiat now had to develop the business.\n",

      "\n",
      "US crude prices have soared to fresh four-month highs above $53 in the US as refinery problems propelled petrol prices to an all-time high.\n",
      "\n",
      "US light sweet crude futures jumped to $53.09 a barrel in New York before closing at $53.03. The gains tracked a surge in US gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon. The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company's refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production. A spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running. \"This market simply wants to go up,\" Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency. Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: \"Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere, a refinery in Houston was closed due to mechanical problems, while on Tuesday production at BP's Texas City refinery was taken down for a short time. In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. The rise in prices came despite a US government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec's recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. Instability in Iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played a part in the rally.\n",

      "'Fido' to be taken off vote lists\n",
      "\n",
      "The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are some of the mistakes found under the current system, where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected. But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual \"identifiers\" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard. And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. Non-British citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. He argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at \"hard to reach\" voters, for example. Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "He argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. He said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. Currently, British voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. Mr Younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.\n",

      "Ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. Details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday's figures offer a progress check. They will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.\n",

      "Police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. The 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. Exeter and Cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.\n",

      "Prime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. There are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.\n",

      "He is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. \"We have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,\" he will say. Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.\n",

      "Ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. More work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before CSOs, they argued in a the study. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that \"about a third\" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.\n",

      "\n",
      "The controversial issue was a feature of the recent US presidential election, where George Bush opposed extending it. But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Motor Neurone disease. \"I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,\" he said. The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. But he argued: \"We mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. \"Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. \"With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people's lives as they grow older. \"I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. \"I respect those concerns. But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Howard acknowledged there were \"no easy answers\" over such an issue but it was necessary to \"have the courage to do what we know to be morally right\". He added: \"Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. More research needs to be done. But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. The hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved.\" Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident.

Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. The home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not \"well informed\". Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.\\n\\nHe said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002. Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam. But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead. Mr Mubanga said the \"MI6 agent\" told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission. Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.\\n\\nHis lawyer Louise Christian said: \"\\'We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo.\" And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats\\' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga\\'s transfer to Guantanamo.

Some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking.

And funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800GMT to look after children while their parents were at work. Taken together, the measures would create a \"welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history\", said Mr Brown. He also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners, with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. In a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year, the chancellor said he was providing an extra £1bn for local councils. The money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.\\n\\nMr Brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt \"low and sustainable\" - both in this economic cycle and the next. Borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in March\\'s budget, as already announced by the Office for National Statistics. Borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than Mr Brown predicted in his March budget.

Ms Essex said: \"I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. \"I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.\" She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, \"even for those people who have moved up a band\".\\n\\nThe settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said: \"This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.\" Plaid Cymru\\'s local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement \"hugely disappointing\". He said: \"Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger.\" \"This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both.\" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said: \"I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.\" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change \"is taking spin to the very verge of deception\". He added: \"Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.\"\\n'}, {'file': '115.txt', 'content': 'New drink limit \\'would cut toll\\'\\n\\nMore lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says.\\n\\nUniversity College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the government\\'s Road Safety Bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK\\'s roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year.\\n\\nA previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport Document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year. The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. Professor Allsop said: \"Reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver\\'s BAC [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit. \"Only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times.\"\\n\\nMinisters do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. They believe educating drivers is more important. The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers\\' attitudes to drink-driving. Road safety head Andrew Howard said: \"It remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.\\n\\n\"Parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. Britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone.\" Liberal Democrat transport spokesman John Thurso said drink-driving remained a \"major killer\", with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. He said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997, which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. The Road Safety Bill, which gets its second reading on Tuesday, would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed. It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system, penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties. In an article for the Times newspaper, Ms Dunwoody, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, says: \"Slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists. \"It is quite simple: if you hit someone at 30mph, they have a 50 per cent chance of survival. If you are going at 40mph, nine times out of ten they will die.\"\\n'}, {'file': '049.txt', 'content': 'BMW cash to fuel Mini production\\n\\nLess than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced £100m of new investment.\\n\\nSome 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday\\'s announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production.\\n\\nSince its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.\\n\\nLast year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,\" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"The risk is that after they\\'ve invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,\" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.\\n\\nThe price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from £12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker\\'s. The consumers\\' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.\\n\\nThe Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.\\n\\nThere are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW\\'s Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory\\'s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.\\n'}, {'file': '075.txt', 'content': 'EU ministers to mull jet fuel tax\\n\\nEuropean Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.\\n\\nA levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world\\'s poorest nations.

Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.\\n\\nThe apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive.

But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. But that did not happen for \"voter identification\" calls. \"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,\" he said. \"So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service.\"\\n\\nHe said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers. She said: \"We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do things that are not allowed in the law.\" A spokesman for the Information Commissioner\\'s Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person. \"If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,\" he said.\\n\\nThe spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. The spokesman said there was \"no yes or no\" answer and the area was \"pretty grey\". He added: \"If someone complained, then we would investigate that. Political parties are aware of the regulations. At the last by-elections, we reminded them.\" Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: \"The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal.\" He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are \"significant\" numbers of such calls. \"I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,\" he tells the commissioner.

The total delays amounted to 62 months, with average individual delays rising by three months.\\n\\nSir John Bourn, head of the NAO, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. \"Many problems can be traced to the fact that the MoD has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,\" the report says.

He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.\\n\\nExplaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: \"I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. \"However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. \"To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. \"I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.\"\\n\\nLabour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was \"very clever\" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. \"He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,\" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings \"where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner\". However, MSPs\\' Code of Conduct \"recognises a wider definition\" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.\\n\\nBut a letter from Holyrood\\'s Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie\\'s decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: \"This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn\\'t breach the paid advocacy rules in future. \"However it doesn\\'t change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.\"\\n\\nScottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. Ms Sturgeon said: \"I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and I\\'m sure he will be reflecting on it.\" She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not \"lose any sleep over it\". Peter Misselbrook, executive partner of Tods Murray said Mr McLetchie had been considering retirement later in the year.

Mr Brown is currently touring Africa after a week of facing questions about reports of his splits with Downing Street.\\n\\nWith the election widely predicted for May, angry Labour MPs this week warned Mr Blair and Mr Brown about the dangers of disunity. Now Mr Blair is trying to put the focus on the substance of Labour\\'s platform for a third term in government.

On Wednesday they unveiled a poster which pictured the prime minister and Mr Brown under the words \"How can they fight crime when they are fighting each other?\" Michael Howard and frontbencher John Redwood on Thursday launched new plans to abolish hundreds of quangos. They say government is spending too much and lower taxes are needed to make Britain more competitive.\\n\\nThe Liberal Democrats have also claimed infighting its obstructing good government. The latest speculation about relations between New Labour\\'s two most powerful figures came after the publication of a new book, Brown\\'s Britain by Robert Preston. In it he alleges that Mr Blair told Mr Brown in 2003 he would step down as prime minister before the coming general election. The book claims the premier went back on his pledge after support from Cabinet allies and suspicion that Mr Brown was manoeuvring against him. Mr Peston\\'s book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\" On Wednesday Mr Blair directly denied Mr Brown made that quote, and before he left for Africa on Tuesday the chancellor told reporters: \"Of course I trust the prime minister.\"\\n'}, {'file': '072.txt', 'content': 'S Korean consumers spending again\\n\\nSouth Korea looks set to sustain its revival thanks to renewed private consumption, its central bank says.\\n\\nThe country\\'s economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers\\' credit card spending spree. Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year. \"The economy is now heading upward rather than downward,\" said central bank governor Park Seung. \"The worst seems to have passed.\" Mr Park\\'s statement came as the bank decided to keep interest rates at an all-time low of 3.25%. It had cut rates in November to help revive the economy, but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in January - has stopped it from cutting further. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. Other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health. Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December. Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers\\' bad debts.

The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\\n\\n\"We\\'re surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February\\'s Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\\n\\nGermany\\'s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany\\'s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.\\n'}, {'file': '106.txt', 'content': 'Howard attacks cost of asylum\\n\\nMichael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain\\'s \"chaotic\" asylum system under Tony Blair.\\n\\nThe Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997. Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters\\' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused.

People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused,\" he said. \"And let\\'s be clear. Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain\\'s generosity.\" Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party\\'s plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.\\n\\nThat prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees\\' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. \"If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven,\" said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council. \"If people turn up in the UK asking for help they will be turned away. Michael Howard\\'s policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the UK. \"When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. So many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned, rising to half for some nationalities. \"We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much.\"\\n\\nTony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.

The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour\\'s campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.\\n\\nWriting in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking. \"As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labour\\'s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities.\" BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown\\'s article was \"a warning shot\" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. \"It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,\" was Mr Marr\\'s assessment. The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown\\'s article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor\\'s role would be \"central\". Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was \"in part\" because of Mr Brown\\'s management of the economy.

As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\\n\\nThe FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries\\' access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\\n\\nAccording to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product.

The Federal Statistics Office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%, after a year of contraction in 2003, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward. Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves. Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. According to the statistics office, Destatis, rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand.\\n\\nBut the relentless rise in the value of the euro last year has also hit the competitiveness of German products overseas. The effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole, as well as Germany. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but senior officials at the rate-setting European Central Bank are beginning to talk about the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.

On Thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon\\'s Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP\\'s two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas\\' deputy leader. UKIP\\'s chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.\\n\\nMr Kilroy-Silk announced his decision to quit UKIP at a public meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire last week. It came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June\\'s European elections. \"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said. \"I will be standing at the next general election.

Qualifications for religious leaders to enter the UK could also be made tougher, she told a Commons inquiry. Her comments have been described as \"irresponsible\" and \"outrageous\" by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC).\\n\\n\"The threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of Islam, or who are falsely hiding behind Islam,\" the Salford MP told the Commons home affairs committee.\\n\\n\"It means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community.\" It was a reality that should be recognised, she said. \"If a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area,\" she added. On ministers of religions, such as imams, she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills, such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community, should be demanded. Last year, ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak English to a certain level.\\n\\nIHRC chairman Massoud Shadjareh accused Ms Blears of \"playing an Islamophobia card\" in the run-up to a general election.\\n\\n\"She is demonising and alienating our community,\" he said. \"It is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. \"This sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists.\" Later, the prime minister\\'s official spokesman urged people to put Ms Blears\\' comments into context. The minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.\\n\\n\"What is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community. \"It is not aimed at a particular community, it is not police policy to aim these powers at a particular community,\" he added. Statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the UK since the 11 September attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were Muslim, he added Figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.\\n\\nFigures showed that, for 2003/2004, Asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year. Separate figures on police searches in England and Wales carried out under the Terrorism Act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted. Muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws. In 2003/2004, 12.5% searches under the laws were on Asian people, even though they make up 4.7% of the population. Last July, the police were accused of Islamophobia by Muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of Asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti-terror laws.\\n'}, {'file': '104.txt', 'content': 'Royal couple watch nation\\'s mood\\n\\nPrince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation\\'s reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.\\n\\nMrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple\\'s decision to marry. But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.\\n\\nThe poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: \"I\\'m just coming down to earth.\" She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters. Charles said he and his wife-to-be were \"absolutely delighted\". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.\\n\\nThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them \"very happy\". Princes William and Harry said they are \"very happy\" and wish the couple \"all the luck in the future\". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George\\'s Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.\\n\\nThe marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. \"His divorce from Diana and the disappointment the country felt over how Diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince Charles],\" said Ros Coward, who wrote the authorised biography of Diana, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: \"I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step.\" Tony Blair said he was \"delighted\" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. Australia\\'s Prime Minister John Howard also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a \"sensible and a good thing\".

During that time, restrictions were put on planes taxiing, taking off and landing at Frankfurt\\'s Rhein-Main airport. The extra time taken by President Bush and his entourage meant that there was a knock-on effect that led to significant delays.

The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China\\'s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year.

However, the company said AOL\\'s underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL\\'s existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\\n\\nTime Warner\\'s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts\\' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\\n\\nTimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators.

The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a \"bad piece of legislation\". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.\\n\\nHowever, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.\\n\\nThe EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to \\'bumping\\' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger\\'s will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.\\n\\nHowever, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to \"extraordinary circumstances\". Airlines fear that \"extraordinary circumstances\" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. \"It\\'s a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n\\nThe European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.\\n\\nEC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were \"grey areas\" but said \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out\". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA\\'s Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. \"We reckon it\\'s going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that\\'s over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,\" Mr Clarke said. \"That\\'s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. \"The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers\\' right.\" \"This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people\\'s daily lives,\" he added.

Rod Eddington, BA\\'s chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA\\'s profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.\\n\\nTo help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.\\n\\nIn October, it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA\\'s estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.\\n\\nIt also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January.

Inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of Japan\\'s most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country\\'s leading politicians. He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 1998. But last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways, one of his companies. Under Japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.\\n\\nMr Tsutsumi\\'s fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies. His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. The illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II, he has described the demands his father made. \"I felt enormous pressure when I dined with him and it was nothing but pain,\" Tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. \"He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. He didn\\'t let me use the silk futon, saying it\\'s a luxury.\" There have been corporate governance issues at some other Japanese companies too. Last year, twelve managers from Mitsubishi Motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from Japan\\'s troubled UFJ bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank\\'s bad loans.\\n'}, {'file': '023.txt', 'content': 'Mixed signals from French economy\\n\\nThe French economy picked up speed at the end of 2004, official figures show - but still looks set to have fallen short of the government\\'s hopes.\\n\\nAccording to state statistics body INSEE, growth for the three months to December was a seasonally-adjusted 0.7-0.8%, ahead of the 0.6% forecast.

Advisors Goldman Sachs are understood to have valued its demerged Deluxe Film unit at £300m, the report added. Speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since Rank announced a study into a possible demerger in September. Since Mike Smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the Odeon cinema chain and the Pinewood studios. The move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, Hard Rock and Deluxe Films, which provides technical services to Hollywood studios.\\n\\nRank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its Hard Rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. It also owns Deluxe Media, which makes and distributes DVDs and videos. However, that business is seen as less successful. Last year it made profits of £21.5m on a turnover of £392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to DVDs from VHS video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. A spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on Friday. Analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to £170m from £194m last year. Formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading UK film producer and cinema owner for many years. It has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the UK - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. It now owns 34 Grosvenor casinos, the Mecca Bingo chain and more than 100 Hard Rock Cafes in 38 countries.\\n\"}, {'file': '009.txt', 'content': 'Ethiopia\\'s crop production up 24%\\n\\nEthiopia produced 14.27 million tonnes of crops in 2004, 24% higher than in 2003 and 21% more than the average of the past five years, a report says.\\n\\nIn 2003, crop production totalled 11.49 million tonnes, the joint report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme said.

He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week.

He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n\\nHe acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don\\'t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour.

At a conference on developing enterprise hosted by UK finance minister Gordon Brown on Friday, he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks. \"A flexible exchange rate is one more channel for absorbing both positive and negative shocks,\" he told the conference. India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, has been invited to take part in the G7 meeting taking place in London on Friday and Saturday.

The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an \\'always available\\' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling \\'on the move\\' using their mobile phones.\\n\\nThe surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres\\' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.\\n\\nIn what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer\\'s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.\\n\\nSuggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.\\n\\nThere are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:\\n\\n- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", \\n - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, \\n - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents.

However, it has bounced back strongly with growth of just under 5% expected in 2004.\\n'}, {'file': '019.txt', 'content': 'India widens access to telecoms\\n\\nIndia has raised the limit for foreign direct investment in telecoms companies from 49% to 74%.\\n\\nCommunications Minister Dayanidhi Maran said that there is a need to fund the fast-growing mobile market. The government hopes to increase the number of mobile users from 95 million to between 200 and 250 million by 2007. \"We need at least $20bn (£10.6bn) in investment and part of this has to come as foreign direct investment,\" said Mr Maran. The decision to raise the limit for foreign investors faced considerable opposition from the communist parties, which give crucial support to the coalition headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Potential foreign investors will however need government approval before they increase their stake beyond 49%, Mr Maran said. Key positions, such as those of chief executive, chief technology officer and chief financial officer are to be held by Indians, he added.\\n\\nAnalysts and investors have welcomed the government decision. \"It is a positive development for carriers and the investment community, looking to take a longer-term view of the huge growth in the Indian telecoms market,\" said Gartner\\'s principal analyst Kobita Desai. \"The FDI relaxation coupled with rapid local market growth could really ignite interest in the Indian telecommunication industry,\" added Ernst and Young\\'s Sanjay Mehta.

The cash raised will go towards the UK\\'s nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a \"nuclear dumpsite\".\\n\\nUnder current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a \"sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries\". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity.\\n\\nTrade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to £680m for Britain\\'s nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency.

This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, GM said. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon.\\n\\nThe NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. GM is also recalling 19,924 Cadillac XLR coupes, SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the 2004 model year. This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. In addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 Buick Raniers, Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. However, GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. News of the recall follows an announcement last month that GM expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. The world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business, weak US sales and now a product recall.

His claims were denied by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who accused the Tories of \"running scared\" of debate. EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued.\\n\\nMr Straw used Thursday\\'s Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005. Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw. Africa and climate change would also feature highly. He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe\\'s economic output and were spent \"where it adds most value\". Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK\\'s budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was \"fully justified\". \"We, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,\" he said.\\n\\nMr Ancram condemned the document, which the Foreign Office says has cost about £2,500 to design, print and deliver. \"Isn\\'t the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new EU to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?,\" he asked. The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand. \"The government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this \\'easy and simple\\' constitution to the British people,\" he said. \"Who are they trying to kid?\" The proposed question for the constitution referendum is: \"Should the United Kingdom approve the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union?\" The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. The government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the Tories set to campaign for a \"no\" vote.\\n\\nMr Ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. The foreign secretary hit back by saying Tory attitudes to Europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a \"level playing field\" on immigration and asylum controls. \"You are setting your face against all of these things,\" he added. For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy.

If Wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more MPs. Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. \"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers?\" he said. Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: \"This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people\\'s lives by reducing the size and role of the State\".\\n\\nMr Howard said the plan would also even out the \"great unfairness\" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England.

He also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity \"retirement and health programmes would need \"significant\" changes. He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.\\n\\nMeanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit.

The tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; £910m). Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. Spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. All the spending increases will run over the next three years.\\n\\nUnveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%.\\n\\nHe predicted that the South African economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. Mr Manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.\\n\\n\"In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,\" said Mr Manuel. He said that the economic situation was a \"marked improvement\" on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged.

Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.\\n\\nAnalysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world\\'s airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.\\n\\nIt is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing\\'s twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\\n\\n\"Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. But the 777-200LR \"is a niche player\", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.\\n\\nFor Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. It has been producing a rival to Boeing\\'s 777 line for more than a year. \"Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said Flight International\\'s Mr Learmount.\\n\\nBoth Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. These orders should help underpin the company\\'s profits. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract.

This current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside Wales.\\n\\nDetails about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the New Year. In England, the current target for inpatients - seeing a consultant to having an operation - is six months. Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), welcomed the new targets \"to make further and faster progress on waiting lists\". \"However, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because Wales still lags a long way behind England,\" he said. \"Capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that Welsh patients don\\'t receive a worse service than patients over the border.\" Health analyst Tony Beddow, from the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care, called the new targets \"reasonably impressive\".\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Ms Hutt also announced £264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in Wales.\\n\\nMs Hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting \"unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year\". \"We are turning the corner on long waits in Wales.

The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. Mr O\\'Brien said UK businesses were sprinting forward in ICT use, but that there were more challenges ahead. The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.\\n\\nIt showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. Mr O\\'Brien said: \"The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring. \"It is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years.\" The government would play its part in \"cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish\", Mr O\\'Brien said. The \"clear message\" the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.\\n\\n\"However, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the UK is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy,\" he added.

He said police would challenge the \"one of two isolated hunts\" which are threatening to break the law.\\n\\nBut Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. \"The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. \"You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. He has rejected a \"blanket policy\" of not enforcing the ban until the House of Lords has considered its legality. John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices.

Under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.\\n\\nAs well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to \"flush out\" foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. \"We are not going away.

But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that \"people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about\".

Analysts say improving India\\'s infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. The Indian government\\'s decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some Indian firms.\\n\\nA spokesman for DLF Builders, Dr Vancheshwar, told the BBC this will mean \"better offerings\" for consumers as well as builders. He said the firm will benefit from world class \"strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumers will have better choice.\"\\n\\nThe government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the \\'automatic route\\' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. The automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which can be bureaucratic. The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries.\\n\\nMr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. \"Foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,\" said Mr Nath, without specifying the timeframe. Previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the Indian market. This measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. Anshuman Magazine, managing director, of CB Richard Ellis - an international real estate company - told the BBC this was \"a big positive step.\"\\n\\nHowever, Chittabrata Majumdar, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said allowing FDI in the country is compromising India\\'s own \"self reliance\".

The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4\\'s World At One.

The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said. Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries.

Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\\n\\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\\n\\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\\n\\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year\\'s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month.

But a target of 1.5 million more by 2010 needed \"creative\" ideas. Some 26 million adults lack maths or English skill levels expected of school-leavers.\\n\\nAccording to the report, \"more than half\" the qualifications achieved were by learners aged 16 to 18. These are defined as \"adults\" by the government for the purpose of compiling these figures. Normally adults are defined as being aged over 19. The number of these people gaining qualifications was \"rising slowly\". Auditor General Sir John Bourn said: \"Higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit England both socially and economically. \"More people will have the opportunity to live richer lives.\" In 2001, the government launched the Get On scheme - aimed at reducing illiteracy and innumeracy. Sir John said \"substantial progress\" had been made since, adding that this was \"only the beginning\". The government and its partners would \"need to be creative and responsive\". Some £3.7bn will be spent on implementing the programme by 2006. The report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand. Existing adult learners could use their \"enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge\" to attract other people. The Department for Education and Skills could also use more \"personalised learning\" and work with voluntary groups, councils and employers.\\n\\nIt should also assess adult learners\\' progress \"at frequent intervals\", the report adds. When the government announced it had reached its 2004 target earlier this month, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was \"only the start of the journey\". An estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level. This is thought to cost the UK economy hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The qualifications achieved by those taking part in the government\\'s scheme range up to GCSE equivalents. Get On\\'s participation target has been set at 2.25 million by 2010, with an interim figure of 1.5 million by 2007. Education minister Ivan Lewis said: \"We will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace.\" Shadow Education Secretary Tim Collins said: \"This is the third report in two days to highlight Labour\\'s failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life. \"Employers and business leaders have repeatedly voiced concern over the number of school-leavers without these basic skills, but all the government have offered is more talk.\" Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis added: \"Far too little has been done to enable adult learners to fit learning into their busy lives.\"\\n'}, {'file': '094.txt', 'content': 'McConnell in \\'drunk\\' remark row\\n\\nScotland\\'s first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk \"once in a while\".\\n\\nJack McConnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.

They will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.\\n\\nHe also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for Aids and malaria. The chancellor is travelling to America next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"We need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health, of illiteracy, of poverty, particularly in Africa but right through the developing countries.\"\\n\\nHis proposals were effectively a new \"Marshall Plan\" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year.

The European Union\\'s Common Agricultural Policy had caused aggravated trade problems, he said, but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.\\n\\nMr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years.

Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. As a result, they say, Italy\\'s corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. At the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy\\'s entrepreneurial spirit.\\n\\nThe government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy\\'s 60 million population.

As well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. He also listed what he dubbed the nine \"most useless quangos\". They were the British Potato Council, the Milk Development Council, the Energy Savings Trust, Agricultural Wages Committees, the Wine Standards Board, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Football Licensing Authority, Investors in People UK and the Economic and Social Research Council. Mr Lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee Potato Council, set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets, \"surprising\". He said the £80m spent annually on the Energy Savings Trust, which promotes renewable energy, would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for British homes.\\n\\nAnd he argued it was \"absurd\" to charge farmers for Agricultural Wages Committees, which set working and wage standards in the industry, when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £1 an hour. \"If a football team can afford to pay £27m for Wayne Rooney, why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the Football Licensing Authority to the tune of over £1.1m a year?\" Mr Lewis asked. The report is published by the Efficiency in Government Unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the Economic Research Council and the Centre for Policy Studies. It says before a new public body is set up, an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.\\n'}, {'file': '091.txt', 'content': 'Vouchers \\'to cut winter deaths\\'\\n\\nPensioners are being promised energy savings by the Liberal Democrats, as snow and cold temperatures continue.\\n\\nThe party says the plans could save the average pensioner £100 every year and cut winter deaths. The government gives £200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60, or £300 where people are over 80. The Tories promise to keep the payments. The Lib Dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey said: \"The current scheme has helped some older people, but this new Liberal Democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year.\" The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. The plan would boost energy conservation, says the party - and insulation could save £100 every year for pensioner households, so using the money more \"intelligently\" than at present.\\n'}, {'file': '087.txt', 'content': 'Howard unveils Tory asylum plans\\n\\nTory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said.\\n\\nAs his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. Some charities say the plans would put refugees\\' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.\\n\\nTony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.\\n\\nIn a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It\\'s not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\" He said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that \"firm but fair\" immigration controls were essential for good community relations.\\n\\n\\n - Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers \\n - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents \\n - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for \"national security\" \\n - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps. Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. \\n \\n\\nThe Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK.\\n\\nMr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough. The plans would help achieve a \"substantial reduction\" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure. He said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current \"unfair and inhumane\" system.\\n\\n\"We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum,\" Mr Howard said. \"By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.\"\\n\\nBut the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans \"dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible\". Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.\\n\\nHe did not think Mr Howard intended to centre the debate about race. But he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture.

But the Home Office says it may be in the children\\'s best interests if it reunites them with their communities.\\n\\nThe pilot, included in the government\\'s five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.\\n\\nSince 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These children automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities. Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.\\n\\nUnder the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the \"best interest\" of a child in their care. Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania.\\n\\n\"If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,\" she said. \"We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania]. \\'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.\" In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing \"the difficult issue\" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children \"and leave them to rot\". \"We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,\" said the spokesman. \"We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it\\'s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.\\n\\n\"We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children\\'s legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities.\" The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations. Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said. But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. \"From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,\" said Mr Hogg. \"In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. \"The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.\" A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.\\n'}, {'file': '044.txt', 'content': 'Japan economy slides to recession\\n\\nThe Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.\\n\\nGross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. The fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in GDP in the two previous quarters. The Tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. On Wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips Japan into recession.\\n\\nA previous estimate of 0.1% growth between July and September was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.\\n\\nFigures released by the government\\'s Cabinet Office showed that GDP, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. However, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. \"The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,\" said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka. Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. \"The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone,\" Mr Takenaka stressed.\\n\\nMinisters pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan\\'s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. Japan\\'s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. However, the economy\\'s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. \"The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn\\'t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,\" said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

However, Nestle\\'s profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\\n\\nNestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream. Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.\\n\\nElsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth. Nestle added that it had performed strongly in Africa and Asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability. Nestle\\'s total earnings before interest remained broadly flat over the past year, despite the company managing to boost profit margins. As well as increasing its dividend, Nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn Swiss francs ($861m; £451m). Looking forward, Nestle forecasts organic earnings growth of about 5% in 2005, although it warned that trading would remain just as competitive.\\n\\nUncertainty remains over the future of Perrier, the iconic French mineral water owned by Nestle.

More video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. It is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.\\n\\nMinisters say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs\\' plan, Lord Falconer said: \"One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims. \"The needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.\\n\\n\"Courts, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first, without compromising the rights of the defendant.\" He went on: \"Giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience, especially when you\\'re a victim. \"Yet with a will and with support it can be done.\" Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. Other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts. \"You are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence,\" he said. \"But you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, it\\'s not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.\"\\n\\nThe plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday. Ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the Lords have over-ruled this. Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament. The person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the House of Lords, he said, and should be the best person chosen from either House of Parliament.

But 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says.\\n\\nIt argues that the price of not investing in poor countries\\' sustainable development will be felt across the world. The report said: \"Global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. \"Environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders.

But both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats said Dr Gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile Ms Hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were \"only 10% of the health agenda. Dr Gibbons, who was a GP in Blaengwynfi, in the Upper Afan Valley, before becoming AM for Aberavon, said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after \"tremendous change and reform\". One of the biggest problems which had faced Ms Hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly\\'s first health minister was the length of waiting lists in Wales.\\n\\nIn November the British Medical Association said NHS staff were \"weeping with despair\" as figures showed 311,000 people were waiting for treatment in Wales, up by 2,400 on the previous month. In the same month lists in England were at their lowest for 17 years, with 856,600 people waiting for treatment. Dr Gibbons told Radio Wales: \"There is no doubt that, in managing waiting lists, England has done a lot of very very useful work, and we do need to learn from that.\"\\n\\nBut he said the NHS in Wales also needed to create a healthier population rather than respond only to ill health, and a balanced view of priorities was important. \"We do need a consistent across-the-board approach, recognising the patients\\' experience of how they use the service is going to be, at the end of the day, the main test of how the service is working.\" He said NHS staff wanted a period of consolidation after \"tremendous change and reform\". Later, Dr Gibbons praised the work of Ms Hutt, saying he \"agreed with everything she\\'s done\" to change the health service in Wales. Dr Gibbons said he accepted there was a problem, but his job now was to build on the foundations put in place by his predecessor. He also acknowledged that until the waiting list issue was sorted out, the rest of the assembly government\\'s health policy would be overshadowed.\\n\\nOpposition members and some Labour MPs had long called for Ms Hutt\\'s removal after sustained criticism over extended hospital waiting times. First Minister Rhodri Morgan told BBC Wales he had agreed with Ms Hutt in 2003 that she would not be health minister in the run-up to the 2007 elections. \"She\\'s been doing the job for five years and eight months and, apart from Nye Bevan himself, (architect of the NHS), I don\\'t think anybody has ever done the job for so long.\" Mr Morgan said he had only told Ms Hutt of the reshuffle on Monday morning, and said the NHS in Wales was Dr Gibbons\\' \"baby\" now. In response to Dr Gibbons\\' comments, Ieuan Wyn Jones, leader of the Plaid Cymru group in the assembly, said: \"It is apparent that this reshuffle by the first minister was just changing the deckchairs on a sinking Titanic.\" Kisrty Williams, for the Lib Dems, added: \"If the underlying policy is going to continue, then changing the minister will serve no purpose, other than to deflect flak from Labour\\'s MPs,\" she said. Meanwhile Ms Hutt said she hoped \"that the people of Wales would benefit from my investment of the past five years and eight months\" Asked about waiting lists, she said that waiting times and lists were \"only 10% of the health agenda\" and that the Welsh Assembly Government had \"turned the corner\" on the issue.\\n'}, {'file': '125.txt', 'content': 'UKIP candidate suspended\\n\\nEurosceptic party UKIP have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.\\n\\nJohn Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election.

Steps being considered include listing Ferrari and bringing Maserati and Alfa Romeo closer together, it said. Despite strong sales of Alfa Romeo, Fiat's car business is making a loss.\\n\\nUnder the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. Fiat owns a 56% stake in Ferrari -best known for its dominant Formula One motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. It considered floating Ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to Italian bank Mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). That sale valued Ferrari - which owns the Maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. Such a move would help Alfa Romeo and Maserati to share marketing, distribution and research & development costs. Maserati and Ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.\\n\\nFiat, Italy's largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes.

In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. The rise in prices came despite a US government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec\\'s recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. Instability in Iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played a part in the rally.\\n'}, {'file': '079.txt', 'content': '\\'Fido\\' to be taken off vote lists\\n\\nThe risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said.\\n\\nThose are some of the mistakes found under the current system, where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. Voters need to register by 11 March if the next poll is on 5 May as expected. But any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in Britain before that general election.\\n\\nThe proposed scheme would mean voters using individual \"identifiers\" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system. There have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the MPs heard. And some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. Non-British citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.\\n\\nMr Younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. He argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at \"hard to reach\" voters, for example. Some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail\\'s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.\\n\\nHe argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. He said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. The MPs on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Constitutional Affairs select committees pressed Mr Younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. He said the Northern Ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. Currently, British voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. Mr Younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.\\n'}, {'file': '092.txt', 'content': 'New \\'yob\\' targets to be unveiled\\n\\nFifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in England and Wales will be named on Thursday.\\n\\nTen areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. Details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday\\'s figures offer a progress check. They will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.\\n\\nPolice have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. The 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. Exeter and Cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.\\n\\nPrime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. There are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.\\n\\nHe is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. \"We have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,\" he will say. Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.\\n\\nMinisters also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. More work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before CSOs, they argued in a the study. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that \"about a third\" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.\\n'}, {'file': '086.txt', 'content': 'Howard backs stem cell research\\n\\nMichael Howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.\\n\\nThe controversial issue was a feature of the recent US presidential election, where George Bush opposed extending it. But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimer\\'s, Parkinson\\'s and Motor Neurone disease. \"I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,\" he said. The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body\\'s tissue types. Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.\\n\\nMr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. But he argued: \"We mustn\\'t be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. \"Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. \"With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people\\'s lives as they grow older. \"I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. \"I respect those concerns. But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson\\'s, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer\\'s and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.\"\\n\\nMr Howard acknowledged there were \"no easy answers\" over such an issue but it was necessary to \"have the courage to do what we know to be morally right\". He added: \"Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. More research needs to be done. But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. The hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved.\" Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. Mr Howard made his remarks during a speech in Westminster to the Conservative National Women\\'s Committee on ambitions and values.\\n'}]\n"
